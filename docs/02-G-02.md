#  Indigenous Flora {-}

This section focuses on the normal (indigenous) flora found on the skin, in soft tissues, and in bone, as well as their Gram stain and colony morphology characteristics. Understanding normal flora is crucial for differentiating between commensal organisms and true pathogens when analyzing clinical specimens

## **Normal Flora** {-}

*   **Skin:** The skin harbors a diverse community of microorganisms, with the composition varying depending on factors like moisture, pH, and the presence of sebaceous glands
    *   **Predominant Genera**
        *   ***Staphylococcus* spp.:** These are the most common inhabitants, particularly *Staphylococcus epidermidis*
        *   ***Corynebacterium* spp. (Diphtheroids):** Gram-positive, pleomorphic rods
        *   ***Propionibacterium* spp.:** Anaerobic or aerotolerant, often found in hair follicles and sebaceous glands. *Propionibacterium acnes* is a common example
        *   ***Micrococcus* spp.:** Gram-positive cocci
        *   ***Malassezia* spp.:** Yeasts, often found in areas with high sebum production
        *   ***Acinetobacter* spp.:** Gram-negative coccobacilli
        *   **Less Common, but Present:** *Bacillus* spp., *Candida* spp., *Enterococcus* spp
*   **Soft Tissues:** The normal flora in deeper soft tissues is usually sparse, as these areas are not typically exposed to the external environment. However, bacteria can be introduced through minor breaches in the skin
    *   **Common Genera**
        *   ***Staphylococcus* spp.:** Similar to the skin
        *   ***Corynebacterium* spp. (Diphtheroids):** Also present
        *   ***Anaerobes* spp.:** These are present in deeper tissues, including *Peptoniphilus*, *Finegoldia*, and *Cutibacterium*
*   **Bone:** Bone is normally sterile. Therefore, the presence of any bacteria in bone tissue is considered significant
    *   **Sterile Site:** Bone is usually sterile, and any organisms isolated from bone biopsies are considered clinically significant

## **Gram Stain Morphology** {-}

The Gram stain is a crucial initial step in the identification process, providing valuable information about the bacteria's cell wall structure and morphology

*   **Skin Flora**
    *   ***Staphylococcus* spp.:** Gram-positive cocci, typically arranged in clusters, often appearing as "grape-like" clusters
    *   ***Corynebacterium* spp.:** Gram-positive rods, often pleomorphic (varying in shape), can appear as "Chinese letters" or "palisades"
    *   ***Propionibacterium* spp.:** Gram-positive rods, often short and plump, can appear singly or in small groups. Can be slightly curved
    *   ***Micrococcus* spp.:** Gram-positive cocci, typically in tetrads or clusters
    *   ***Malassezia* spp.:** Gram stain will show yeast cells (often oval or round) and hyphae or pseudohyphae
    *   ***Acinetobacter* spp.:** Gram-negative coccobacilli, can appear as pairs or short chains
    *   *Bacillus* spp.: Gram-positive rods, often larger than other Gram-positive rods
    *   *Candida* spp.: Gram positive yeast, budding yeast
    *   *Enterococcus* spp.: Gram-positive cocci, often in pairs or short chains
*   **Soft Tissue Flora**
    *   The Gram stain morphology is similar to that of skin flora, but the presence of anaerobic bacteria may be more likely
    *   **Anaerobes:** Gram stain characteristics vary, ranging from Gram-positive cocci and rods to Gram-negative rods
*   **Bone Flora**
    *   The Gram stain morphology will depend on the specific organism isolated

## **Colony Morphology** {-}

Colony morphology refers to the visual characteristics of bacterial colonies growing on agar plates. These characteristics provide important clues for identification

*   **Skin Flora**
    *   ***Staphylococcus* spp.**
        *   **Appearance:** Typically, colonies are round, smooth, and opaque
        *   **Color:** Can range from white to cream to sometimes yellowish
        *   **Size:** Colonies are usually moderate in size
        *   **Hemolysis:** *S. aureus* is often beta-hemolytic (complete clearing of the blood agar). *S. epidermidis* is usually non-hemolytic
    *   ***Corynebacterium* spp.**
        *   **Appearance:** Colonies can be small and pinpoint or larger and more variable
        *   **Color:** Can be white, cream, or yellowish
        *   **Texture:** Can be smooth, rough, or dry
    *   ***Propionibacterium* spp.**
        *   **Appearance:** Colonies are usually small, pinpoint, and translucent or opaque
        *   **Color:** Can be white to cream
        *   **Other:** Often requires anaerobic conditions for optimal growth
    *   ***Micrococcus* spp.**
        *   **Appearance:** Colonies are small, round, and smooth
        *   **Color:** Typically yellow, sometimes white or cream
        *   **Texture:** Smooth, often with a glistening appearance
    *   ***Malassezia* spp.**
        *   **Appearance:** Colonies are typically small, cream-colored, and may appear "yeasty."
        *   **Growth:** Requires special media (e.g., Sabouraud dextrose agar with olive oil) and prolonged incubation
    *   ***Acinetobacter* spp.**
        *   **Appearance:** Colonies can be smooth, round, and opaque, or they may have a slightly irregular edge
        *   **Color:** Can be white, cream, or slightly gray

        *   **Color:** Can be white, cream, or gray
        *   **Other:** Often grow well on blood agar and may show alpha-hemolysis (greenish discoloration) or no hemolysis
*   **Soft Tissue Flora**
    *   The colony morphology is similar to that of skin flora
    *   **Anaerobes:** Colonies often have a characteristic odor and may exhibit varying colony morphology
*   **Bone Flora**
    *   The colony morphology will depend on the specific organism isolated

## **Clinical Significance** {-}

*   **Differentiating between Colonization and Infection**
    *   The presence of normal skin flora in a wound or soft tissue culture does not necessarily indicate infection. It is crucial to consider the patient's clinical presentation, the quantity of the organism, and the presence of other organisms
    *   **True Pathogens:** The isolation of organisms not typically found in the normal flora (e.g., *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Enterobacteriaceae* in a skin wound) is more likely to indicate infection
    *   **Increased Numbers:** A high number of organisms that are part of the normal flora may indicate infection, especially if the patient has risk factors such as a weakened immune system or a foreign body present
*   **Contamination:** Normal skin flora can contaminate specimens during collection. Careful attention to sterile technique is essential to minimize contamination
*   **Polymicrobial Infections:** Skin and soft tissue infections can be polymicrobial, involving multiple organisms, including both normal flora and potential pathogens
*   **Osteomyelitis:** In bone infections, any organism isolated is considered clinically significant

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Normal Flora:** The microorganisms that typically colonize a specific body site without causing disease under normal circumstances
*   **Commensal Organisms:** Microorganisms that live in or on a host without causing harm
*   **Opportunistic Pathogens:** Organisms that are normally harmless but can cause disease in individuals with weakened immune systems or other predisposing factors
*   **Gram-Positive:** Bacteria that retain the crystal violet dye in the Gram stain, appearing purple

*   **Cocci:** Spherical-shaped bacteria
*   **Rods (Bacilli):** Rod-shaped bacteria

*   **Anaerobic:** Growing in the absence of oxygen
*   **Sterile Site:** A body site that is normally free of microorganisms
*   **Polymicrobial:** Involving multiple microorganisms
