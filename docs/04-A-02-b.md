# Vesicles & Lesions {-}

This section covers viruses that cause vesicles and lesions, focusing on Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV). We'll cover their etiology, epidemiology, transmission, and the specific disease states they cause

## **Etiology, Epidemiology, Transmission, and Disease States** {-}

### **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)** {-}

*   **Etiology**
    *   **Classification:** A member of the *Herpesviridae* family
    *   **Types**
        *   **HSV-1:** Typically associated with oral herpes (cold sores) but can also cause genital herpes
        *   **HSV-2:** Typically associated with genital herpes but can also cause oral herpes
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Global Distribution:** HSV is found worldwide
    *   **Prevalence:** Very common, with a high percentage of the population infected with HSV-1 and a significant proportion infected with HSV-2
    *   **Age Groups**
        *   **HSV-1:** Often acquired in childhood through non-sexual contact
        *   **HSV-2:** Typically acquired through sexual contact
*   **Transmission**
    *   **Direct Contact:** Spread through direct contact with an active lesion or through asymptomatic shedding (virus being present without visible symptoms)
    *   **Sexual Contact:** HSV-2 is primarily transmitted through sexual contact
    *   **Mother to Child:** Can be transmitted from mother to child during childbirth (neonatal herpes)
*   **Disease States**
    *   **Oral Herpes (Cold Sores):** Characterized by painful blisters on or around the lips
    *   **Genital Herpes:** Characterized by painful blisters on the genitals, buttocks, or inner thighs
    *   **Herpetic Whitlow:** Infection of the fingers or around the fingernails
    *   **Herpes Keratitis:** Infection of the cornea of the eye, which can lead to blindness
    *   **Herpes Encephalitis:** A rare but serious infection of the brain
    *   **Neonatal Herpes:** Can cause severe illness in newborns, including skin, eye, and mouth infections, encephalitis, and disseminated disease
    *   **High-Risk Groups:** Immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk for severe HSV infections

### **Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV)** {-}

*   **Etiology**
    *   **Classification:** A member of the *Herpesviridae* family
    *   **Relationship:** Causes two distinct diseases: varicella (chickenpox) and herpes zoster (shingles)
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Global Distribution:** VZV is found worldwide
    *   **Chickenpox:** Historically, a common childhood disease, but incidence has decreased significantly with the introduction of the varicella vaccine
    *   **Shingles:** Occurs in individuals who have previously had chickenpox. The virus remains dormant in nerve cells and can reactivate later in life
    *   **Age Groups**
        *   **Chickenpox:** Primarily affects children
        *   **Shingles:** More common in older adults and immunocompromised individuals
*   **Transmission**
    *   **Chickenpox**
        *   **Airborne Droplets:** Spread through airborne droplets produced when infected individuals cough or sneeze
        *   **Direct Contact:** Can also be transmitted through direct contact with lesions
    *   **Shingles**
        *   **Direct Contact:** Spread through direct contact with lesions. Shingles is not spread through the air
        *   **Risk to Others:** Individuals with shingles can transmit VZV to people who have never had chickenpox or been vaccinated, causing them to develop chickenpox
*   **Disease States**
    *   **Varicella (Chickenpox):** Characterized by a widespread, itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters
        *   **Complications:** Secondary bacterial infections of the skin, pneumonia, encephalitis, and, rarely, death
    *   **Herpes Zoster (Shingles):** Characterized by a painful rash with blisters that typically occurs in a single stripe on one side of the body
        *   **Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN):** Chronic pain that can persist for months or years after the shingles rash has resolved
        *   **Ophthalmic Zoster:** Shingles involving the eye, which can lead to vision loss
        *   **Disseminated Zoster:** Widespread rash involving multiple dermatomes, more common in immunocompromised individuals
    *   **High-Risk Groups**
        *   **Chickenpox:** Unvaccinated individuals, pregnant women, and immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk for severe disease
        *   **Shingles:** Older adults and immunocompromised individuals are at higher risk for shingles and complications

### **Important Notes** {-}

*   **Prevention**
    *   **Varicella Vaccine:** Highly effective in preventing chickenpox
    *   **Zoster Vaccine:** Available to prevent shingles and its complications
*   **Diagnosis**
    *   **HSV/VZV:** Diagnosed through viral culture, PCR, or direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) testing of lesion specimens
*   **Treatment**
    *   **Antiviral Medications:** Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are used to treat HSV and VZV infections

### **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Etiology:** The cause or origin of a disease or condition
*   **Epidemiology:** The study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the control of health problems
*   **Transmission:** The way a disease is spread from one person or source to another
*   **Vesicle:** A small, fluid-filled blister
*   **Lesion:** An area of damaged tissue or skin
*   **Asymptomatic Shedding:** The presence and shedding of a virus without visible symptoms
*   **Neonatal Herpes:** HSV infection in newborns
*   **Herpetic Whitlow:** HSV infection of the fingers or around the fingernails
*   **Herpes Keratitis:** HSV infection of the cornea of the eye
*   **Herpes Encephalitis:** HSV infection of the brain
*   **Varicella:** Chickenpox
*   **Herpes Zoster:** Shingles
*   **Postherpetic Neuralgia (PHN):** Chronic pain that persists after the shingles rash has resolved
*   **Ophthalmic Zoster:** Shingles involving the eye
*   **Disseminated Zoster:** Widespread shingles rash involving multiple dermatomes
*   **Dermatome:** An area of skin supplied by a single spinal nerve
