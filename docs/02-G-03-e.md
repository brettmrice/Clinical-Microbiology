#  Zoonotic {-}

This section focuses on the colony morphology and identification of major pathogens associated with zoonotic infections that can affect the skin, soft tissues, and bones. These include *Bacillus anthracis*, *Brucella* spp., *Francisella tularensis*, and *Yersinia* spp. 

**Important Note:** These organisms are potential bioterrorism agents and/or pose significant laboratory safety risks. All procedures must be performed in a BSL-2 or BSL-3 laboratory with appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) and protocols. Consultation with a laboratory supervisor, infectious disease specialist, and/or public health officials is crucial
