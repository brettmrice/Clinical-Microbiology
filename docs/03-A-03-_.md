# Stain, Morph, Growth {-}

This section discusses the analytic procedures related to acid-fast reaction, colony morphology, and growth characteristics for major pathogens, common contaminants, and less common Mycobacterium pathogens

**The Big Picture: A Multi-Faceted Approach**

Identifying Mycobacteria and Nocardia in the lab is rarely a "one-test-fits-all" situation. Instead, it's a process of gathering clues from different sources and putting them together to arrive at an accurate identification. Three key areas provide these clues: the acid-fast reaction, colony morphology, and growth characteristics

**Acid-Fast Reaction: The First Line of Defense**

The acid-fast stain is a fundamental tool. Mycobacteria and Nocardia have waxy cell walls containing mycolic acids, which cause them to retain the primary dye (carbolfuchsin) even after treatment with acid-alcohol. This is what makes them "acid-fast." While most members of these genera are acid-fast, the intensity can vary. For example, Nocardia may be weakly acid-fast, requiring a modified staining technique

**Colony Morphology: Visual Inspection**

Once a culture grows, observing the colonies provides further information. Key features include:

*   **Shape:** Are the colonies round, irregular, or filamentous?
*   **Size:** Are they pinpoint or large and spreading?
*   **Texture:** Are they smooth, rough, wrinkled, or mucoid?
*   **Color:** Are they buff, cream, yellow, orange, pink, or white? Some species are *photochromogenic*, meaning they produce pigment only when exposed to light, while others are *scotochromogenic*, producing pigment in the dark

**Growth Characteristics: Understanding Growth Requirements**

Mycobacteria are known for their slow growth, requiring specialized media and longer incubation times compared to typical bacteria. Important factors include:

*   **Growth Rate:** How quickly do colonies appear? Rapid growers form colonies within a week, while slow growers may take several weeks
*   **Temperature:** What is the optimal temperature for growth? Some species, like *M. marinum*, prefer lower temperatures
*   **Media Requirements:** Do they require specific nutrients or supplements, such as iron for *M. haemophilum*?
*   **Atmosphere:** Are they strict aerobes (requiring oxygen)?

**Differentiating Key Players**

*   ***M. tuberculosis*:** Rough, dry, buff-colored colonies on egg-based media, slow growth, and positive niacin and nitrate reduction tests
*   ***MAC (M. avium complex)*:** Smooth, transparent to opaque colonies, slow growth
*   ***M. kansasii*:** Photochromogenic colonies, relatively rapid growth, and positive nitrate reduction test
*   ***M. marinum*:** Photochromogenic colonies, slow growth, and prefers lower temperatures
*   ***M. abscessus*:** Rapidly growing, can grow on MacConkey agar, and often causes skin and soft tissue infections
*   ***M. gordonae*:** A common contaminant, with deep yellow to orange scotochromogenic colonies
*   ***Nocardia spp.*:** Weakly acid-fast, wrinkled, dry colonies, and relatively slow growth
*   ***M. leprae*:** An obligate intracellular parasite that cannot be cultured on artificial media
*   ***M. haemophilum*:** Requires iron supplementation for growth
*   ***M. scrofulaceum*:** Causes scrofula, produces yellow to orange scotochromogenic colonies
