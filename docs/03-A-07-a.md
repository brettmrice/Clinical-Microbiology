# Broth Microdilution {-}

This section will focus on broth microdilution, a key method for determining the antimicrobial susceptibility of Mycobacteria and Nocardia species. We'll explore the principles, procedure, advantages, and limitations of this technique

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Purpose:** Broth microdilution is a quantitative method used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of an antimicrobial agent against a specific organism
*   **MIC:** The MIC is defined as the lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that inhibits the visible growth of the organism after a specified incubation period
*   **Quantitative Results:** Broth microdilution provides quantitative MIC values, which can be used to categorize organisms as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant based on established breakpoints
*   **Standardized Method:** Standardized broth microdilution methods are available from organizations such as the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
*   **Clinical Significance:** MIC values obtained from broth microdilution testing can be used to guide antimicrobial therapy and predict clinical outcomes

## **Procedure** {-}

*   **Preparation of Antimicrobial Agents**
    *   **Stock Solutions:** Prepare stock solutions of antimicrobial agents in appropriate solvents according to manufacturer's instructions
    *   **Serial Dilutions:** Prepare serial two-fold dilutions of the antimicrobial agents in a suitable broth medium (e.g., cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth, Middlebrook 7H9 broth)
*   **Preparation of Inoculum**
    *   **Standardization:** Prepare a standardized inoculum of the test organism in a suitable broth medium. The inoculum density is typically adjusted to a specific turbidity (e.g., 0.5 McFarland standard)
    *   **Dilution:** Dilute the standardized inoculum to the appropriate concentration for testing
*   **Microdilution Plate Setup**
    *   **Microdilution Plates:** Use sterile, disposable microdilution plates with multiple wells. Each well contains a specific concentration of the antimicrobial agent
    *   **Inoculation:** Inoculate each well of the microdilution plate with the standardized inoculum
    *   **Controls:** Include appropriate controls, such as:
        *   **Growth Control:** Wells containing broth medium and inoculum but no antimicrobial agent
        *   **Sterility Control:** Wells containing broth medium only to check for contamination
        *   **Quality Control Strains:** Wells inoculated with quality control strains of known susceptibility to verify the accuracy of the test
*   **Incubation**
    *   **Temperature and Atmosphere:** Incubate the microdilution plates at the appropriate temperature and atmosphere for the test organism (e.g., 35°C in ambient air for most bacteria, 30°C for *M. marinum*)
    *   **Incubation Time:** Incubate the plates for the recommended incubation time, which varies depending on the organism (e.g., 18-24 hours for most bacteria, several days to weeks for Mycobacteria)
*   **Reading and Interpretation**
    *   **Visual Inspection:** After incubation, examine the microdilution plates visually to determine the MIC. The MIC is the lowest concentration of the antimicrobial agent that inhibits visible growth of the organism
    *   **Turbidity:** Wells with growth will appear turbid, while wells without growth will appear clear
    *   **Quality Control:** Verify that the results for the quality control strains are within the acceptable range
    *   **Interpretation:** Interpret the MIC values based on established breakpoints to categorize the organism as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant

## **Advantages** {-}

*   **Quantitative Results:** Provides quantitative MIC values, which are more informative than qualitative results (e.g., disk diffusion)
*   **Automation:** Can be automated, allowing for high-throughput testing
*   **Cost-Effective:** Relatively cost-effective compared to other methods, especially when automated
*   **Versatile:** Can be used to test a wide range of antimicrobial agents and organisms
*   **Standardized:** Standardized methods are available from CLSI and other organizations

## **Limitations** {-}

*   **Labor-Intensive:** Manual broth microdilution can be labor-intensive
*   **Subjectivity:** Visual reading of the microdilution plates can be subjective
*   **Media and Reagents:** Requires specialized media and reagents
*   **Time-Consuming:** Can be time-consuming, especially for slow-growing organisms
*   **Interpretation Challenges:** Interpretation of MIC values can be challenging, especially for organisms with unusual resistance mechanisms or limited breakpoint data
*   **Biofilms:** Broth microdilution may not accurately predict the activity of antimicrobial agents against organisms growing in biofilms
