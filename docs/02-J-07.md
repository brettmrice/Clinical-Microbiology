## **Interpretation: Deciphering the Genetic Code** {-}

*   **PCR and qPCR**
    *   **Positive Result:** Presence of the amplified product (PCR) or a detectable fluorescent signal (qPCR) indicates the presence of the target sequence and the bacterium
    *   **Negative Result:** Absence of the amplified product or fluorescent signal indicates the absence of the target sequence, and the bacterium is either absent or below the detection limit
    *   **Quantitative Results (qPCR):** The *cycle threshold (Ct) value* is inversely proportional to the amount of target DNA in the sample. Lower Ct values indicate a higher bacterial load
*   **Sequencing**
    *   **Sequence Alignment:** The sequence is *aligned* with a database of known sequences
