# Sterile Technique {-}

Sterile technique is the cornerstone of accurate and reliable results. It's not just a set of rules; it's a mindset that we cultivate to protect our samples, our experiments, and ultimately, our patients

## **Sterile Technique: The Foundation of Accurate Microbiology** {-}

*   **What is Sterile Technique?**
    *   Sterile technique is a set of practices and procedures designed to minimize the risk of contamination by microorganisms during laboratory procedures

    *   Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
    *   Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer (at least 60% alcohol) if soap and water are not available
    *   Perform hand hygiene:
        *   Before and after working in the lab
        *   Before and after wearing gloves
        *   After touching potentially contaminated surfaces
        *   Before eating, drinking, or smoking
*   **Technique**
    *   Wet hands with water
    *   Apply soap and rub hands together vigorously, covering all surfaces
    *   Rinse hands thoroughly under running water
    *   Dry hands with a clean paper towel

    *   Maintain a "zone of sterility" around the work area
    *   Avoid reaching across the sterile field
    *   Keep the sterile field in constant view
*   **Maintaining Sterility**
    *   Only sterile items can touch the sterile field

    *   Use instruments and equipment before the expiration date
*   **Opening Sterile Packages**
    *   Open sterile packages carefully to avoid contaminating the contents
    *   Peel back the packaging, rather than tearing it open
    *   Avoid touching the inside of the package
*   **Transferring Sterile Items**
    *   Use sterile forceps or other instruments to transfer sterile items
    *   Avoid touching the part of the instrument that will come into contact with the sterile field
    *   Keep the tips of the instruments pointed downward
