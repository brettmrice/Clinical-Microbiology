#  Organism Pathogenicity {-}

This section focuses on the pathogenicity of the microorganisms discussed previously, covering their etiology (the cause of the disease), modes of transmission, and the virulence mechanisms they employ to cause infection and disease. A thorough understanding of these aspects is critical for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of genital tract infections

## ***Neisseria gonorrhoeae*** {-}

### **Etiology** {-}
*   **Organism:** Gram-negative diplococcus, oxidase-positive, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*
*   **Disease:** Gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted infection

### **Transmission** {-}
*   **Mode:** Primarily transmitted through sexual contact (vaginal, anal, or oral sex) with an infected partner
*   **Other:** Can be transmitted from mother to child during childbirth (causing ophthalmia neonatorum in the newborn)

### **Virulence Mechanisms** {-}
*   **Attachment**
    *   **Pili:** Hair-like structures that mediate attachment to host cells (e.g., epithelial cells of the urethra, cervix, rectum, pharynx, and conjunctiva)
    *   **Opa Proteins:** Surface proteins that promote adherence to host cells
*   **Antigenic Variation**
    *   **Pili Variation:** The pili undergo antigenic variation, making it difficult for the host immune system to develop effective immunity
*   **Invasion and Survival**
    *   **Por Proteins:** Promote bacterial survival by interfering with phagocytosis and complement activation
    *   **LOS (Lipooligosaccharide):** Endotoxin that causes inflammation and tissue damage
    *   **IgA Protease:** Cleaves IgA antibodies, preventing them from neutralizing the bacteria
*   **Consequences**
    *   **Inflammation:** Triggers an inflammatory response in the infected tissues, leading to symptoms such as urethritis (in men), cervicitis (in women), and proctitis (in both sexes)
    *   **Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI):** In rare cases, the bacteria can disseminate to the bloodstream, causing septic arthritis, skin lesions, and endocarditis
    *   **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID):** In women, untreated gonorrhea can ascend the genital tract, leading to PID, which can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain
    *   **Ophthalmia Neonatorum:** Infection of the newborn's eyes, which can lead to blindness if not treated promptly

## ***Chlamydia trachomatis*** {-}

### **Etiology** {-}
*   **Organism:** Gram-negative obligate intracellular bacterium, *Chlamydia trachomatis*
*   **Disease:** Chlamydia, a sexually transmitted infection

### **Transmission** {-}
*   **Mode:** Primarily transmitted through sexual contact (vaginal, anal, or oral sex) with an infected partner
*   **Other:** Can be transmitted from mother to child during childbirth (causing conjunctivitis or pneumonia in the newborn)

### **Virulence Mechanisms** {-}
*   **Invasion and Survival**
    *   **Elementary Body (EB):** The infectious form of the bacterium. The EB attaches to host cells and is internalized through endocytosis
    *   **Reticulate Body (RB):** The metabolically active, replicating form of the bacterium, which resides within a vacuole (inclusion) inside the host cell
    *   **Inclusion Formation:** Prevents fusion of the vacuole with lysosomes, allowing the bacteria to replicate within the host cell
*   **Host Cell Damage**
    *   **Cytokine Production:** The infection triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines, leading to tissue damage
    *   **Cell Lysis:** The bacteria eventually lyse the host cell, releasing new EBs to infect other cells
*   **Consequences**
    *   **Urethritis:** In men, chlamydia can cause urethritis, leading to dysuria, and urethral discharge
    *   **Cervicitis:** In women, chlamydia can cause cervicitis, often asymptomatic, but may cause vaginal discharge, bleeding, and pelvic pain
    *   **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID):** Untreated chlamydia can ascend the genital tract, leading to PID, which can cause infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain
    *   **Epididymitis:** In men, chlamydia can cause epididymitis (inflammation of the epididymis)
    *   **Proctitis:** Inflammation of the rectum
    *   **Lymphogranuloma Venereum (LGV):** A more invasive form of *C. trachomatis* infection caused by specific serovars, characterized by the formation of painful genital ulcers and swollen lymph nodes
    *   **Conjunctivitis:** Can cause conjunctivitis in both adults and newborns

## ***Streptococcus agalactiae*** (Group B Streptococcus, GBS) {-}

### **Etiology** {-}
*   **Organism:** Gram-positive coccus, *Streptococcus agalactiae* (GBS)
*   **Disease:** GBS infections, primarily in newborns

### **Transmission** {-}
*   **Mode**
    *   **Vertical Transmission:** From mother to newborn during childbirth. The bacteria colonize the vagina and rectum of pregnant women, and the newborn can be exposed to the bacteria during passage through the birth canal
    *   **Colonization:** GBS can colonize the genital tract and rectum of both men and women
*   **Other:** Rarely, transmission can occur through direct contact

### **Virulence Mechanisms** {-}
*   **Capsule**
    *   **Polysaccharide Capsule:** The capsule is the primary virulence factor. It helps the bacteria evade phagocytosis and complement-mediated killing
    *   **Capsular Serotypes:** The capsule is composed of different serotypes (Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII), and the serotype of the GBS strain influences the severity of the infection
*   **Surface Proteins**
    *   **C5a Peptidase:** Inactivates the complement component C5a, which is a chemoattractant for neutrophils
    *   **Beta-hemolysin/Cytolysin:** Damages host cells
*   **Consequences**
    *   **Neonatal Infections**
        *   **Early-Onset GBS Disease:** Occurs within the first week of life, usually presenting as sepsis, pneumonia, or meningitis. The bacteria are acquired during delivery
        *   **Late-Onset GBS Disease:** Occurs after the first week of life, often presenting as meningitis. The bacteria may be acquired from the mother or other sources
    *   **Maternal Infections**
        *   **Chorioamnionitis:** Infection of the amniotic fluid
        *   **Endometritis:** Infection of the uterine lining
        *   **Wound Infections:** After cesarean section or vaginal delivery
