## ***Eikenella corrodens*** {-}

*   **Colony Morphology**
    *   **Agar Plate**
        *   **Blood Agar**
            *   **Incubation:** Requires incubation in a microaerophilic or anaerobic environment
            *   **Size:** Small to medium (0.5-1 mm in diameter)
            *   **Shape:** Circular, convex
            *   **Color:** Grayish, translucent
            *   **Texture:** Smooth, often with a "pitting" or "corroding" appearance (especially after prolonged incubation)
            *   **Odor:** May have a bleach-like odor
            *   **Hemolysis:** Non-hemolytic
    *   **Gram Stain**
        *   Gram-negative rods
        *   Non-motile
*   **Identification Methods**
    *   **1. Presumptive Identification**
        *   **Gram Stain:** Gram-negative rods
        *   **Colony Morphology:** Small, gray, and "pitting" colonies on blood agar
        *   **Catalase Test:** Negative
        *   **Oxidase Test:** Positive
    *   **2. Definitive Identification**
        *   **Biochemical Tests**
            *   **Glucose Fermentation:** Negative
            *   **Lactose Fermentation:** Negative
            *   **Nitrate Reduction:** Positive
            *   **Lysine Decarboxylase:** Positive
            *   **Ornithine Decarboxylase:** Negative
            *   **Indole Production:** Negative
        *   **Commercial Identification Systems**
            *   **API NH:** A miniaturized biochemical test system
            *   **Vitek 2 System:** Automated identification system
            *   **MALDI-TOF MS:** Provides a rapid and accurate identification of microorganisms based on their protein profiles

## **Additional Considerations** {-}

*   **Mixed Cultures:** Bite wound infections are often polymicrobial, involving multiple organisms from the animal's oral flora and potentially other pathogens. The most common organisms isolated from bite wounds are *Pasteurella multocida* and *Eikenella corrodens*. Other organisms that may be isolated include:
    *   ***Staphylococcus* spp.**
    *   **Beta-hemolytic streptococci**
    *   **Anaerobes:** (e.g., *Bacteroides*, *Fusobacterium*, *Prevotella*)
*   **Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing:** Perform AST on all significant isolates to guide antibiotic therapy. *Pasteurella multocida* is typically susceptible to penicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and tetracycline. *Eikenella corrodens* is typically susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate
*   **Clinical Correlation:** Always correlate the laboratory findings with the patient's clinical presentation, including the type of animal bite, location, and any other relevant signs and symptoms
*   **Reporting:** Report the identified organisms, their colony counts (if quantitative cultures were performed), Gram stain morphology, and antimicrobial susceptibility results (if applicable) to the clinician

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Bipolar Staining:** A staining pattern where the bacteria stain more intensely at the ends of the cells
*   **Microaerophilic:** Requiring or tolerating only a small amount of oxygen
*   **Pitting/Corroding:** A colony morphology describing a colony that appears to have a small depression or "bite" taken out of it
*   **Musty Odor:** A characteristic smell sometimes associated with *Pasteurella multocida*
*   **Bleach-like Odor:** A characteristic smell sometimes associated with *Eikenella corrodens*
*   **AST:** Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
*   **Anaerobe:** A bacterium that grows in the absence of oxygen
*   **Polymicrobial:** Involving multiple microorganisms
