# Dematiaceous Molds {-}

These fungi are characterized by their dark pigmentation, which is due to the presence of melanin in their cell walls. We'll cover the key genera – *Alternaria*, *Cladosporium*, and *Fonsecaea* – along with their disease states, transmission, and lab identification methods

## **Dematiaceous Molds** {-}

*   **Definition:** Dematiaceous molds are a diverse group of filamentous fungi characterized by dark-pigmented hyphae and conidia
