# Antimicrobial Therapy {-}

This section provides a brief overview of the antimicrobial therapy for *M. tuberculosis*, *M. avium complex (MAC)*, *M. kansasii*, *M. marinum*, and rapid growers (RGM)

**The Foundation: Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST)**

Regardless of the organism, DST is a cornerstone. It helps determine which drugs are most likely to be effective against the specific isolate causing the infection. This is especially critical because resistance patterns vary significantly among these organisms

***Mycobacterium tuberculosis***

*   **Goal:** Eradicate the infection, prevent relapse, and prevent transmission
*   **Standard Regimen:** A 6-month course of combination therapy
    *   **Intensive Phase (2 months):** Isoniazid (INH), Rifampin (RIF), Pyrazinamide (PZA), Ethambutol (EMB)
    *   **Continuation Phase (4 months):** Isoniazid (INH), Rifampin (RIF)
*   **Drug Resistance:** A major concern. MDR-TB (resistant to INH and RIF) and XDR-TB (resistant to INH, RIF, fluoroquinolones, and at least one injectable second-line drug) require complex, prolonged treatment with second-line drugs
*   **Key Strategies:** Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) to ensure adherence, rapid diagnosis, and DST

***Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)***

*   **Goal:** Control symptoms, prevent disease progression, and improve quality of life
*   **Treatment:** Combination therapy with a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin) as the foundation
    *   Typically combined with ethambutol and rifamycin (rifampin or rifabutin)
    *   Aminoglycosides may be added in severe cases
*   **Duration:** Prolonged, often lasting at least 12 months after sputum cultures turn negative
*   **Special Considerations:** Drug interactions (especially with HIV medications), macrolide resistance

***Mycobacterium kansasii***

*   **Goal:** Eradicate the infection
*   **Treatment:** Rifampin-based regimen
    *   Isoniazid (INH), rifampin, and ethambutol
*   **Duration:** At least 12 months after sputum cultures turn negative
*   **Key Feature:** Generally susceptible to rifampin, making treatment more straightforward

***Mycobacterium marinum***

*   **Goal:** Eradicate the infection, especially in skin and soft tissues
*   **Treatment:** Options include tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline), macrolides (clarithromycin, azithromycin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin), rifampin, ethambutol, or TMP/SMX
*   **Duration:** Typically 3-6 months, depending on severity
*   **Special Considerations:** Often associated with aquatic exposures (fish tanks, swimming pools)

**Eapidly Growing Mycobacteria (RGM)**

*   **Goal:** Eradicate the infection, which can be challenging due to resistance
*   **Species:** *M. abscessus* group, *M. chelonae*, *M. fortuitum*
*   **Treatment:** Highly variable depending on the species and DST results
    *   *M. abscessus*: Often requires a combination of amikacin, cefoxitin or imipenem, and clarithromycin/azithromycin
    *   Other RGMs: May be susceptible to macrolides, aminoglycosides, carbapenems, linezolid, fluoroquinolones, or tetracyclines
*   **Key Challenges:** *M. abscessus* is notoriously difficult to treat, inducible macrolide resistance
*   **General Principles:** Surgical intervention is often necessary, prolonged treatment durations, inhaled amikacin may be useful for pulmonary infections
