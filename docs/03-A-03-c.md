# Less Common Pathogens {-}

This section covers the characteristics of some of the less frequently encountered Mycobacterium species: *M. leprae*, *M. haemophilum*, and *M. scrofulaceum*. While not as common as *M. tuberculosis* or MAC, it's important to be aware of these organisms and their unique features

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Clinical Presentation:** These species often present with distinct clinical manifestations, which can provide clues to their identification
*   **Special Growth Requirements:** Some of these species have specific growth requirements that must be met for successful isolation in the laboratory
*   **Geographic Distribution:** The prevalence of these species can vary depending on geographic location

## ***Mycobacterium leprae*** {-}

*   **Disease:** Causes leprosy (Hansen's disease), a chronic infectious disease affecting the skin, peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and eyes
*   **Acid-Fast Reaction:** Strongly acid-fast
*   **Colony Morphology**
    *   *M. leprae* has never been successfully grown on artificial media in the laboratory. It is an obligate intracellular parasite
    *   Diagnosis relies primarily on clinical presentation, skin smears, and histopathology
*   **Growth Characteristics**
    *   Cannot be cultured on standard laboratory media
    *   Grows very slowly in the footpads of mice or in armadillos
    *   Optimal growth temperature: 30-33°C
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions
    *   Transmission is thought to occur through respiratory droplets, but the exact mechanism is not fully understood
*   **Diagnosis**
    *   **Clinical Examination:** Look for characteristic skin lesions, nerve damage, and sensory loss
    *   **Skin Smears:** Acid-fast bacilli can be detected in skin smears from affected areas
    *   **Histopathology:** Biopsy of skin or nerve tissue can reveal the presence of acid-fast bacilli and characteristic granulomas
    *   **Molecular Methods:** PCR can be used to detect *M. leprae* DNA in clinical specimens

## ***Mycobacterium haemophilum*** {-}

*   **Disease:** Causes skin and soft tissue infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Can also cause disseminated infections
*   **Acid-Fast Reaction:** Acid-fast
*   **Colony Morphology**
    *   Small, smooth, translucent colonies
    *   May have a slightly pinkish or yellowish tint
*   **Growth Characteristics**
    *   Requires the addition of ferric ammonium citrate or hemin (iron) to the culture medium for growth
    *   Slow-growing: Colonies may take 2-4 weeks to appear
    *   Optimal growth temperature: 30-32°C
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Relatively rare
    *   Found worldwide
    *   Risk factors include:
        *   Immunocompromise (e.g., HIV/AIDS, organ transplant recipients)
        *   Hemodialysis
*   **Diagnosis**
    *   **Culture:** Requires media supplemented with iron
    *   **Acid-Fast Stain:** Detect acid-fast bacilli in clinical specimens
    *   **Molecular Methods:** PCR can be used to detect *M. haemophilum* DNA

## ***Mycobacterium scrofulaceum*** {-}

*   **Disease:** Causes scrofula (cervical lymphadenitis), primarily in children
*   **Acid-Fast Reaction:** Acid-fast
*   **Colony Morphology**
    *   Smooth, round, dome-shaped colonies
    *   Produces a yellow to orange pigment in the dark (scotochromogenic)
*   **Growth Characteristics**
    *   Slow-growing: Colonies may take 2-3 weeks to appear
    *   Optimal growth temperature: 25-37°C
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Found worldwide
    *   More common in children than adults
    *   Associated with exposure to contaminated water
*   **Diagnosis**
    *   **Culture:** Isolate *M. scrofulaceum* from lymph node aspirates or biopsies
    *   **Acid-Fast Stain:** Detect acid-fast bacilli in clinical specimens
    *   **Clinical Presentation:** Consider scrofula in children with cervical lymphadenitis
    *   **Molecular Methods:** PCR can be used to detect *M. scrofulaceum* DNA

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Obligate Intracellular Parasite:** An organism that can only survive and reproduce inside a host cell
*   **Scrofula:** Cervical lymphadenitis caused by mycobacteria, typically *Mycobacterium scrofulaceum*
*   **Hemin:** An iron-containing porphyrin complex that is essential for the growth of some bacteria, including *Mycobacterium haemophilum*
*   **Ferric Ammonium Citrate:** An iron salt that can be used as a source of iron for bacterial growth
*   **Lymphadenitis:** Inflammation of the lymph nodes
*   **Granuloma:** A mass of immune cells that forms when the body attempts to wall off substances it perceives as foreign but cannot eliminate
*   **Skin Smear:** A sample of skin tissue or fluid that is spread on a glass slide and stained for microscopic examination
*   **Histopathology:** The microscopic examination of tissue to diagnose disease
*   **Molecular Methods:** Techniques that use DNA or RNA to identify microorganisms, such as PCR and sequencing
*   **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** A molecular biology technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences
*   **Skin Lesions:** Abnormal changes or growths on the skin, such as sores, bumps, or rashes
*   **Nerve Damage:** Injury to the nerves that can result in pain, numbness, weakness, or loss of function
*   **Sensory Loss:** A decrease or absence of the ability to feel sensations, such as touch, pain, temperature, or vibration
*   **Disseminated Infection:** An infection that has spread from a localized area to other parts of the body
*   **Cervical Lymphadenitis:** Inflammation of the lymph nodes in the neck
*   **Lymph Node Aspirate/Biopsy:** A procedure in which a sample of tissue or fluid is removed from a lymph node for examination
*   **Tropical and Subtropical Regions:** Geographic areas located near the equator that have warm and humid climates
*   **Translucent Colonies:** Colonies that allow light to pass through, making them appear clear or partially transparent
