# Organism pathogenicity {-}

This section explores the pathogenicity of Mycobacteria and Nocardia, focusing on how these organisms cause disease. We'll cover the etiology (causative agents), transmission routes, and the virulence mechanisms that enable them to establish infection and cause harm

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Opportunistic Pathogens:** Many Mycobacteria and Nocardia species are opportunistic pathogens, meaning they primarily cause disease in individuals with weakened immune systems or underlying lung conditions
*   **Intracellular Survival:** A key feature of many Mycobacteria and Nocardia is their ability to survive and multiply within host cells, particularly macrophages
*   **Chronic Infections:** Infections caused by these organisms are often chronic and can be difficult to eradicate
*   **Environmental Reservoirs:** Many of these organisms are found in the environment (soil, water), making complete eradication difficult

## ***Mycobacterium tuberculosis*** {-}

*   **Etiology:** *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). It is a slow-growing, aerobic, acid-fast bacillus
*   **Transmission:** Primarily through airborne droplets produced when people with active pulmonary TB cough, sneeze, speak, or sing. Prolonged close contact is usually required for transmission
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   **Cell Wall Components:** The unique cell wall of *M. tuberculosis*, rich in mycolic acids, contributes to its virulence by:
        *   Protecting the organism from phagocytosis by macrophages
        *   Resisting killing by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) produced by macrophages
        *   Inducing granuloma formation, which can protect the bacteria from the immune system but also contribute to tissue damage
    *   **Cord Factor (Trehalose Dimycolate):** A glycolipid found in the cell wall that:
        *   Inhibits macrophage migration
        *   Induces granuloma formation
        *   Contributes to the characteristic "cording" appearance of *M. tuberculosis* colonies
    *   **ESAT-6 and CFP-10:** Secreted proteins that:
        *   Inhibit macrophage activation
        *   Promote bacterial survival within macrophages
        *   Contribute to the pathogenesis of TB
    *   **Latency:** *M. tuberculosis* can establish a latent infection, in which the bacteria are dormant and cause no symptoms. Latent TB can reactivate later in life, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems
    *   **Immune Evasion:** *M. tuberculosis* employs various strategies to evade the host immune response, including:
        *   Inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages
        *   Modulating cytokine production
        *   Suppressing T cell responses

## ***Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)*** {-}

*   **Etiology:** A group of closely related mycobacteria, primarily *Mycobacterium avium* and *Mycobacterium intracellulare*
*   **Transmission:** Primarily through inhalation or ingestion of contaminated water or soil. Person-to-person transmission is rare
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   **Cell Wall Components:** Similar to *M. tuberculosis*, the cell wall of MAC contributes to its virulence by:
        *   Protecting the organism from phagocytosis
        *   Resisting killing by macrophages
    *   **Biofilm Formation:** MAC can form biofilms in water systems, which can protect the bacteria from disinfectants and contribute to their persistence in the environment
    *   **Intracellular Survival:** MAC can survive and multiply within macrophages, leading to disseminated infections in immunocompromised individuals
    *   **Secretion Systems:** MAC utilizes secretion systems to export proteins that contribute to its virulence
    *    **Glycopeptidolipids (GPLs):** GPLs are surface glycolipids that contribute to biofilm formation, macrophage interactions and serum resistance

## ***Mycobacterium kansasii*** {-}

*   **Etiology:** *Mycobacterium kansasii* is a slow-growing, acid-fast bacillus
*   **Transmission:** Likely through inhalation of contaminated water droplets. Person-to-person transmission is rare
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   **Cell Wall Components:** Similar to other mycobacteria, the cell wall of *M. kansasii* contributes to its virulence
    *   **Intracellular Survival:** *M. kansasii* can survive and multiply within macrophages
    *   **Secretion Systems:** *M. kansasii* utilizes secretion systems to export proteins that contribute to its virulence
    *   **Photochromogenicity:** The production of a yellow pigment when exposed to light may contribute to virulence

## ***Mycobacterium marinum*** {-}

*   **Etiology:** *Mycobacterium marinum* is a slow-growing, acid-fast bacillus
*   **Transmission:** Through direct inoculation of the bacteria into the skin, often through cuts or abrasions exposed to contaminated water (aquariums, swimming pools)
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   **Granuloma Formation:** *M. marinum* induces granuloma formation in the skin
    *   **Intracellular Survival:** *M. marinum* can survive and multiply within macrophages
    *   **Secretion Systems:** *M. marinum* utilizes a type VII secretion system (ESX-1) to export proteins that contribute to its virulence
    *   **Temperature-Sensitive Growth:** *M. marinum* grows best at lower temperatures (30-32Â°C), which may explain its predilection for skin infections

## ***Mycobacterium abscessus*** {-}

*   **Etiology:** *Mycobacterium abscessus* is a rapidly growing mycobacterium
*   **Transmission:** Through direct contact with contaminated water or soil, or through contaminated medical devices. Person-to-person transmission is rare
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   **Rapid Growth:** *M. abscessus* grows more rapidly than other mycobacteria, allowing it to establish infection quickly
    *   **Biofilm Formation:** *M. abscessus* can form biofilms, which protect it from antibiotics and disinfectants
    *   **Intrinsic Antibiotic Resistance:** *M. abscessus* is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics, making treatment challenging
    *   **Cell Wall Components:** The cell wall of *M. abscessus* contains glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) that contribute to its virulence
    *   **Secretion Systems:** *M. abscessus* utilizes secretion systems to export proteins that contribute to its virulence

## ***Nocardia spp.*** {-}

*   **Etiology:** *Nocardia* are aerobic, gram-positive, branching filamentous bacteria that are weakly acid-fast
*   **Transmission:** Primarily through inhalation of dust or soil containing *Nocardia*, or through direct inoculation into the skin
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   **Catalase and Superoxide Dismutase:** These enzymes protect *Nocardia* from killing by reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by phagocytes
    *   **Cord Factor:** Similar to *M. tuberculosis*, *Nocardia* produces cord factor, which contributes to its virulence
    *   **Intracellular Survival:** *Nocardia* can survive and multiply within macrophages
    *   **Proteases:** *Nocardia* produces proteases that can degrade host tissues
    *   **Adherence Factors:** *Nocardia* possesses adherence factors that allow it to attach to host cells
