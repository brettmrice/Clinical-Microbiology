# Organism Pathogenicity {-}

Understanding the pathogenicity of microorganisms that cause infections in normally sterile body fluids is critical for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and prevention of serious complications. Pathogenicity is defined as the ability of a microbe to cause disease, and it is determined by the pathogen's capacity to:

1.  **Colonize:** a host
2.  **Invade:** tissues
3.  **Evade:** the host's immune defenses
4.  **Produce:** toxins or other harmful substances
