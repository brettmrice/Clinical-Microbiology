# Critical Concentration {-}

This section focuses on the critical concentration method, an approach used in antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. It's a simplified method compared to broth microdilution, but it still plays a role in determining drug resistance

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Qualitative Assessment:** The critical concentration method is a qualitative or semi-quantitative AST method used primarily for *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
*   **Single Concentration:** Unlike broth microdilution, the critical concentration method tests the organism's ability to grow (or not grow) in the presence of a *single*, predetermined concentration of an antimicrobial agent
*   **Critical Concentration:** The critical concentration is a specific concentration of an antimicrobial agent that is expected to inhibit the growth of susceptible strains of *M. tuberculosis* but allow the growth of resistant strains
*   **Simplified Method:** Compared to broth microdilution, the critical concentration method is simpler to perform and interpret, making it suitable for resource-limited settings
*   **Rapid Detection of Resistance:** The critical concentration method can provide rapid detection of drug resistance in *M. tuberculosis*
*   **Limitations:** The critical concentration method does not provide quantitative MIC values and may not detect low-level resistance or resistance to multiple drugs

## **Procedure** {-}

*   **Preparation of Media**
    *   **Solid Media:** The critical concentration method typically uses solid media, such as egg-based media (e.g., Löwenstein-Jensen) or agar-based media (e.g., Middlebrook 7H10)
    *   **Antimicrobial Agents:** The antimicrobial agents are incorporated into the media at the predetermined critical concentrations
    *   **Quality Control:** The media should be prepared according to established protocols and quality control procedures to ensure accurate results
*   **Preparation of Inoculum**
    *   **Standardization:** Prepare a standardized inoculum of the *M. tuberculosis* isolate in a suitable broth medium. The inoculum density is typically adjusted to a specific turbidity (e.g., 0.5 McFarland standard)
    *   **Dilution:** Dilute the standardized inoculum to the appropriate concentration for inoculation
*   **Inoculation of Media**
    *   **Media with Antimicrobial Agent:** Inoculate the solid media containing the antimicrobial agent at the critical concentration with the standardized inoculum
    *   **Control Media:** Inoculate control media without the antimicrobial agent with the standardized inoculum to ensure viability and growth of the organism
*   **Incubation**
    *   **Temperature and Atmosphere:** Incubate the inoculated media at the appropriate temperature and atmosphere for *M. tuberculosis* (e.g., 35-37°C in ambient air with 5-10% CO2)
    *   **Incubation Time:** Incubate the media for the recommended incubation time, typically 3-8 weeks
*   **Reading and Interpretation**
    *   **Growth Assessment:** After incubation, examine the media for the presence or absence of growth
    *   **Interpretation**
        *   **Growth on Media with Antimicrobial Agent:** Indicates resistance to the antimicrobial agent
        *   **No Growth on Media with Antimicrobial Agent:** Indicates susceptibility to the antimicrobial agent
        *   **Growth on Control Media:** Confirms viability and growth of the organism
    *   **Quality Control:** Verify that the results for the quality control strains are within the acceptable range

## **Critical Concentrations for Common Anti-TB Drugs** {-}

*   **Isoniazid (INH):** 0.2 μg/mL or 1.0 μg/mL (depending on the medium and method)
*   **Rifampin (RIF):** 40 μg/mL
*   **Ethambutol (EMB):** 2.0 μg/mL or 5.0 μg/mL (depending on the medium and method)
*   **Pyrazinamide (PZA):** 100 μg/mL
*   **Streptomycin (SM):** 4.0 μg/mL or 10.0 μg/mL (depending on the medium and method)

## **Advantages** {-}

*   **Simple to Perform:** The critical concentration method is relatively simple to perform and requires minimal equipment
*   **Cost-Effective:** It is a cost-effective method, especially in resource-limited settings
*   **Rapid Results:** It provides relatively rapid results compared to other methods
*   **Detection of Resistance:** It can detect resistance to common anti-TB drugs

## **Limitations** {-}

*   **Qualitative Results:** It provides only qualitative or semi-quantitative results, without MIC values
*   **Limited Scope:** It tests only a limited number of antimicrobial agents
*   **Detection of Low-Level Resistance:** It may not detect low-level resistance or resistance to multiple drugs
*   **Subjectivity:** Interpretation of growth can be subjective
*   **Media Preparation:** Accurate media preparation is critical for reliable results
*   **Does not replace molecular methods:** Does not detect heteroresistance
