# Organism Pathogenicity {-}

This section reviews the pathogenicity of several key organisms, focusing on their etiology (cause), transmission routes, and virulence mechanisms. We'll examine hepatitis viruses (A, B, C), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella virus, measles virus, West Nile virus and other arboviruses, *Treponema pallidum*, and *Borrelia burgdorferi*

## **Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)** {-}

*   **Etiology:** HAV, a picornavirus (RNA virus)
*   **Transmission:** Fecal-oral route (contaminated food, water, or direct contact)
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   HAV is primarily cytolytic, meaning it directly damages liver cells (hepatocytes)
    *   The host's immune response (T cells) also contributes to liver damage as it targets infected hepatocytes
    *   HAV does not establish chronic infection; liver damage is typically acute and self-limiting

## **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)** {-}

*   **Etiology:** HBV, a hepadnavirus (DNA virus)
*   **Transmission:** Parenteral (blood), sexual contact, mother-to-child (vertical transmission)
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   HBV itself is not directly cytopathic. Liver damage is primarily immune-mediated
    *   The host's immune response (T cells) targets infected hepatocytes, leading to inflammation and damage
    *   HBV can establish chronic infection, where the virus persists in the liver and can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
    *   HBV encodes proteins (e.g., HBeAg) that can suppress the host's immune response

## **Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)** {-}

*   **Etiology:** HCV, a flavivirus (RNA virus)
*   **Transmission:** Primarily parenteral (blood)
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   HCV is not directly cytopathic. Liver damage is primarily immune-mediated
    *   The host's immune response (T cells) targets infected hepatocytes, leading to inflammation and damage
    *   HCV is highly prone to establishing chronic infection due to its high mutation rate, which allows it to evade the host's immune system
    *   HCV can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma
    *   HCV can also cause extrahepatic manifestations, such as cryoglobulinemia and glomerulonephritis

## **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)** {-}

*   **Etiology:** EBV, a herpesvirus (DNA virus)
*   **Transmission:** Saliva (close contact, "kissing disease")
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   EBV infects B cells and epithelial cells
    *   EBV can cause lytic infection (viral replication and cell death) or latent infection (virus persists in the cell without actively replicating)
    *   During latent infection, EBV expresses a limited set of viral genes that promote B cell proliferation and prevent apoptosis (programmed cell death)
    *   EBV is associated with several cancers, including Burkitt lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma
    *   EBV can evade the host's immune system by downregulating MHC class I expression (which reduces T cell recognition)

## **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)** {-}

*   **Etiology:** HIV, a retrovirus (RNA virus)
*   **Transmission:** Sexual contact, parenteral (blood), mother-to-child (vertical transmission)
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   HIV infects CD4+ T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells
    *   HIV uses the enzyme reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA genome into DNA, which is then integrated into the host cell's DNA
    *   HIV replication leads to the destruction of CD4+ T cells, which are critical for immune function
    *   The loss of CD4+ T cells leads to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), characterized by opportunistic infections and cancers
    *   HIV has a high mutation rate, which allows it to evade the host's immune system and develop resistance to antiretroviral drugs
    *   HIV can establish latent infection in resting CD4+ T cells, which serves as a reservoir for the virus

## **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)** {-}

*   **Etiology:** CMV, a herpesvirus (DNA virus)
*   **Transmission:** Close contact (saliva, urine, breast milk, sexual contact, transplantation, blood transfusion), mother-to-child (vertical transmission)
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   CMV can cause lytic infection or latent infection
    *   CMV can infect a wide range of cell types, including epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and immune cells
    *   CMV can evade the host's immune system by downregulating MHC class I expression, interfering with antigen presentation, and producing proteins that inhibit complement activation
    *   CMV can cause serious disease in immunocompromised individuals (e.g., transplant recipients, HIV-infected individuals) and newborns (congenital CMV infection)

## **Rubella Virus** {-}

*   **Etiology:** Rubella virus, a togavirus (RNA virus)
*   **Transmission:** Respiratory droplets
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   Rubella virus is primarily cytopathic in fetal tissues, leading to congenital rubella syndrome (CRS)
    *   CRS can cause a wide range of birth defects, including hearing loss, cataracts, heart defects, and developmental delay
    *   Rubella virus can cross the placenta and infect fetal tissues, leading to inflammation and damage
    *   The severity of CRS depends on the gestational age at the time of infection

## **Measles Virus** {-}

*   **Etiology:** Measles virus, a paramyxovirus (RNA virus)
*   **Transmission:** Respiratory droplets
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   Measles virus is highly contagious and infects respiratory epithelial cells, then spreads to lymphatic tissues and other organs
    *   Measles virus causes a characteristic rash due to immune-mediated damage to small blood vessels
    *   Measles virus can suppress the host's immune system, increasing the risk of secondary infections
    *   Complications of measles include pneumonia, encephalitis, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but fatal neurological disease

## **West Nile Virus (WNV) and Other Arboviruses** {-}

*   **Etiology:** WNV and other arboviruses (e.g., St. Louis encephalitis virus, La Crosse virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Western equine encephalitis virus, Powassan virus), RNA viruses
*   **Transmission:** Mosquitoes (WNV, SLEV, LACV, EEEV, WEEV), ticks (Powassan virus)
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   Arboviruses infect cells in the skin and lymphatic tissues, then spread to the bloodstream and potentially the central nervous system
    *   The host's immune response (cytokines, T cells) contributes to inflammation and damage in the brain (encephalitis)
    *   Some arboviruses (e.g., EEEV) are highly neuroinvasive and cause severe encephalitis with high mortality rates

## **Treponema pallidum** {-}

*   **Etiology:** *Treponema pallidum*, a spirochete bacterium
*   **Transmission:** Primarily through sexual contact, but also congenitally (mother to fetus)
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   *Treponema pallidum* has several virulence factors that allow it to evade the host's immune system and cause disease
    *   It lacks lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent immune stimulant found in many other bacteria
    *   It has a slow metabolism and replicates slowly, making it difficult for the immune system to detect
    *   It can disseminate widely throughout the body, leading to systemic disease
    *   It can cause chronic inflammation and tissue damage, leading to the complications of late syphilis

## **Borrelia burgdorferi** {-}

*   **Etiology:** *Borrelia burgdorferi*, a spirochete bacterium
*   **Transmission:** Through the bite of infected *Ixodes* ticks (deer ticks or black-legged ticks)
*   **Virulence Mechanisms**
    *   *Borrelia burgdorferi* has several virulence factors that allow it to evade the host's immune system and cause disease
    *   It expresses outer surface proteins (Osps) that mediate attachment to tick and host cells
    *   It can vary its surface antigens (antigenic variation), making it difficult for the immune system to clear the infection
    *   It can disseminate widely throughout the body, leading to systemic disease
    *   It can cause chronic inflammation and tissue damage, leading to the complications of late Lyme disease

## **Key Terms** {-}
