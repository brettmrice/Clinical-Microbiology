            *   **Shape:** Round, circular
            *   **Elevation:** Slightly raised
            *   **Color:** Typically golden-yellow or creamy-white, but can sometimes appear white
            *   **Texture:** Buttery, smooth, and opaque

        *   **Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA)**
            *   **Appearance:** Colonies appear yellow on MSA because *S. aureus* can ferment mannitol, producing acid and changing the pH indicator (phenol red) in the media
            *   **Background Color:** The agar surrounding the colonies will also turn yellow
    *   **Gram Stain**
        *   Gram-positive cocci
