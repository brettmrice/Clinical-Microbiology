# Direct Detection {-}

This section covers direct detection of viral pathogens. Direct detection methods aim to identify the virus itself, either by detecting viral particles, viral antigens, or viral nucleic acids, rather than detecting the host's immune response (e.g., antibodies)

    *   **Lateral Flow Immunoassay (Rapid Antigen Test)**
        *   **Principle:** A sample migrates along a membrane containing antibodies specific for the target antigen. If the antigen is present, it binds to the antibodies, resulting in a visible colored line
        *   **Procedure:** Specimen is applied to the test device, and the results are read visually after a specified time
        *   **Applications:** Rapid detection of respiratory viruses (e.g., influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2)
        *   **Advantages:** Rapid turnaround time, simple to perform, no specialized equipment required
