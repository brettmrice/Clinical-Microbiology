# MAI, M. kansasii, M. marinum {-}

This section focuses on the antimicrobial therapy for infections caused by *Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)*, *Mycobacterium kansasii*, and *Mycobacterium marinum*. These nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) require different treatment approaches than *M. tuberculosis* due to their intrinsic resistance patterns

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST):** DST is crucial for guiding treatment decisions for NTM infections, as susceptibility patterns can vary among species and even within species
*   **Combination Therapy:** Treatment of NTM infections typically involves a combination of multiple drugs to improve efficacy and prevent the emergence of drug resistance
*   **Prolonged Treatment Duration:** Treatment durations for NTM infections are often longer than those for *M. tuberculosis* infections
*   **Monitoring for Adverse Effects:** Anti-NTM drugs can cause a variety of adverse effects, and patients should be closely monitored during treatment
*   **Clinical Response:** Clinical response to therapy should be closely monitored, as some NTM infections can be difficult to eradicate

## ***Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)*** {-}

*   **Treatment of Pulmonary MAC Disease**
    *   **Macrolide-Based Regimen:** The cornerstone of treatment is a macrolide antibiotic (clarithromycin or azithromycin) combined with other drugs
    *   **Recommended Regimen**
        *   Clarithromycin or azithromycin
        *   Ethambutol
        *   Rifampin or rifabutin
    *   **Treatment Duration:** Treatment should continue for at least 12 months after sputum cultures convert to negative
    *   **Intermittent Regimens:** Intermittent (e.g., three times per week) regimens may be used in some cases, but daily regimens are generally preferred
    *    **Amikacin or streptomycin:** May be added to the initial regimen in patients with severe disease or extensive cavitary lesions
*   **Treatment of Disseminated MAC Disease (in HIV-Infected Patients)**
    *   **Macrolide-Based Regimen:** Similar to pulmonary MAC disease, treatment is based on a macrolide antibiotic
    *   **Recommended Regimen**
        *   Clarithromycin or azithromycin
        *   Ethambutol
    *   **Rifabutin:** Often added as a third drug, especially if the patient is not taking protease inhibitors
    *   **Treatment Duration:** Treatment should continue for at least 12 months, and secondary prophylaxis (maintenance therapy) is recommended for patients with advanced HIV infection
    *   **Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS):** Patients starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) may develop IRIS, an inflammatory response to the mycobacteria. Management may involve corticosteroids or temporary discontinuation of ART
*   **Drug Susceptibility Testing:** DST should be performed on all MAC isolates to guide treatment decisions. Macrolide resistance is common and can significantly impact treatment outcomes

## ***Mycobacterium kansasii*** {-}

*   **Treatment Regimen**
    *   **Rifampin-Based Regimen:** *M. kansasii* is generally susceptible to rifampin, making it a key component of the treatment regimen
    *   **Recommended Regimen**
        *   Isoniazid (INH)
        *   Rifampin
        *   Ethambutol
    *   **Treatment Duration:** Treatment should continue for at least 12 months after sputum cultures convert to negative
    *   **Alternative Drugs:** In cases of drug resistance or intolerance, alternative drugs such as clarithromycin, moxifloxacin, or streptomycin may be considered
*   **Drug Susceptibility Testing:** DST should be performed to confirm rifampin susceptibility and guide treatment decisions
*   **Monitoring:** Patients should be monitored for adverse effects of INH, rifampin, and ethambutol

## ***Mycobacterium marinum*** {-}

*   **Treatment Regimen**
    *   **Localized Skin Infections:** Mild, localized infections may respond to topical antibiotics or local wound care
    *   **Oral Antibiotics:** More extensive or severe infections typically require oral antibiotics
    *   **Recommended Drugs**
        *   Tetracyclines (e.g., doxycycline, minocycline)
        *   Macrolides (e.g., clarithromycin, azithromycin)
        *   Fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin)
        *   Rifampin
        *   Ethambutol
        *   Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)
    *   **Combination Therapy:** Combination therapy may be necessary for severe or refractory infections
    *   **Treatment Duration:** Treatment duration varies depending on the severity of the infection and the clinical response, but typically ranges from 3-6 months
*   **Drug Susceptibility Testing:** DST is not routinely performed for *M. marinum* infections, as susceptibility patterns are generally predictable
*   **Surgical Excision:** In some cases, surgical excision of infected tissue may be necessary
*   **Temperature Sensitivity:** *M. marinum* grows best at lower temperatures (30-32Â°C), so keeping the affected area warm may inhibit bacterial growth
