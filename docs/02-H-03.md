#  Vaginitis {-}

This section outlines the laboratory methods used to detect the causative agents of vaginitis, a common condition characterized by inflammation of the vagina. The focus is on the detection of *Trichomonas vaginalis*, *Candida* spp., and the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (BV)

## **Trichomonas vaginalis** {-}

### **Microscopic Examination** {-}
*   **Wet Mount**
    *   **Procedure:** A drop of vaginal discharge is mixed with a drop of saline on a microscope slide. A coverslip is applied, and the slide is examined under a microscope at low and high power (400x magnification)
    *   **Visualization:** *T. vaginalis* is a motile, pear-shaped protozoan with flagella. It may be difficult to visualize if the organism is non-motile or if the sample is old. The organism may be identified by its characteristic jerky movement, which is often described as "twitching"
    *   **Sensitivity:** The sensitivity of wet mount is variable, ranging from 50-80%
*   **Gram Stain**
    *   **Procedure:** A Gram stain is performed on a smear of vaginal discharge
    *   **Visualization:** *T. vaginalis* is not readily visible on Gram stain
    *   **Sensitivity:** Not a primary method for detection, but may be seen if present
*   **Pap Smear (Papanicolaou Stain)**
    *   **Procedure:** A cervical smear is stained using the Pap stain
    *   **Visualization:** *T. vaginalis* can be visualized on a Pap smear, but the sensitivity is low. The organism appears as a small, oval or pear-shaped organism with a pale cytoplasm and a small, eccentric nucleus
    *   **Sensitivity:** Low sensitivity, not a primary method for detection

### **Culture** {-}
*   **Procedure:** Vaginal discharge is inoculated onto a specific culture medium designed to grow *T. vaginalis*. Diamond's medium or InPouch TV culture system are commonly used
*   **Incubation:** Cultures are incubated at 37°C for several days
*   **Visualization:** The culture is examined microscopically for the presence of motile organisms
*   **Sensitivity:** Higher sensitivity (75-95%) than wet mount, but results take longer
*   **Advantage:** Can be used for antimicrobial susceptibility testing

### **Rapid Antigen Tests** {-}
*   **Procedure:** These tests detect *T. vaginalis* antigens in vaginal discharge. Several commercially available tests are available
*   **Formats:** Lateral flow immunoassays (similar to home pregnancy tests) and point-of-care tests are available
*   **Sensitivity:** Sensitivity is variable, but generally higher than wet mount
*   **Advantage:** Rapid results (10-30 minutes)
*   **Limitations:** May not be as sensitive as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs)

### **Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs)** {-}
*   **Procedure:** These tests amplify the DNA or RNA of *T. vaginalis*
*   **Formats:** PCR-based assays, transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)
*   **Sensitivity:** Very high sensitivity (95-100%) and specificity
*   **Advantage:** Highly sensitive, can be performed on vaginal swabs or urine samples
*   **Disadvantage:** Requires specialized equipment and trained personnel

## **Candida spp.** {-}

### **Microscopic Examination** {-}
*   **Wet Mount**
    *   **Procedure:** Vaginal discharge is mixed with a drop of saline and a drop of 10% potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution on a microscope slide. The KOH lyses epithelial cells and other debris, making the yeast easier to visualize. A coverslip is applied, and the slide is examined under a microscope at low and high power (400x magnification)
    *   **Visualization:** *Candida* spp. appear as budding yeast cells and/or hyphae (filamentous structures). The presence of hyphae is indicative of a more invasive infection
    *   **Sensitivity:** Moderate sensitivity
*   **Gram Stain**
    *   **Procedure:** A Gram stain is performed on a smear of vaginal discharge
    *   **Visualization:** *Candida* spp. appear as Gram-positive, oval-shaped yeast cells. Budding yeast and/or pseudohyphae may be seen
    *   **Sensitivity:** Moderate sensitivity, similar to wet mount
*   **Pap Smear**
    *   **Procedure:** A cervical smear is stained using the Pap stain
    *   **Visualization:** *Candida* spp. appear as oval, yeast-like organisms
    *   **Sensitivity:** Lower sensitivity compared to wet mount

### **Culture** {-}
*   **Procedure:** Vaginal discharge is inoculated onto a culture medium designed to grow yeast, such as Sabouraud's dextrose agar or CHROMagar Candida
*   **Incubation:** Cultures are incubated at 30°C for several days
*   **Visualization:** *Candida* spp. colonies appear as creamy, white, or buff-colored colonies
*   **Identification:** Colonies can be identified based on colony morphology, Gram stain appearance, and biochemical tests (e.g., germ tube test, carbohydrate assimilation tests)
*   **Sensitivity:** Higher sensitivity than microscopic examination
*   **Advantage:** Allows for species identification and antifungal susceptibility testing (if needed)

### **Rapid Tests** {-}
*   **Germ Tube Test**
    *   **Procedure:** A small amount of yeast colony is mixed with serum and incubated
    *   **Visualization:** *Candida albicans* produces germ tubes, which are hyphae-like structures
    *   **Sensitivity:** High for identifying *C. albicans*
*   **Commercial Rapid Tests**
    *   **Procedure:** Some commercial tests are available that detect *Candida* antigens in vaginal discharge
    *   **Sensitivity:** Variable

## **Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)** {-}

BV is characterized by a disruption of the normal vaginal flora, with a decrease in *Lactobacillus* spp. and an increase in the concentration of other bacteria, including *Gardnerella vaginalis*, *Prevotella* spp., and *Mobiluncus* spp. The diagnosis of BV is primarily based on clinical criteria, but laboratory tests are often used to confirm the diagnosis

### **Amsel's Criteria** {-}
*   **Clinical Diagnosis:** BV is diagnosed if at least three of the following four Amsel's criteria are met:
    1.  **Homogeneous, thin, white or gray vaginal discharge:** The discharge often adheres to the vaginal walls
    2.  **Vaginal pH > 4.5:** Measured using pH paper
    3.  **Positive "Whiff Test" (amine odor):** A drop of 10% KOH is added to a sample of vaginal discharge. A fishy odor (due to the release of amines) is considered a positive result
    4.  **Presence of "Clue Cells" on Wet Mount**
        *   **Procedure:** A wet mount is prepared using vaginal discharge
        *   **Visualization:** Clue cells are vaginal epithelial cells that are coated with bacteria, giving them a characteristic stippled appearance
        *   **Sensitivity:** High specificity

### **Microscopic Examination** {-}
*   **Wet Mount**
    *   **Procedure:** A wet mount is prepared using vaginal discharge
    *   **Visualization**
        *   **Clue Cells:** The hallmark of BV
        *   **Reduced or Absent Lactobacilli:** Decreased numbers of *Lactobacillus* spp
        *   **Increased Numbers of Other Bacteria:** Including *Gardnerella vaginalis*, *Mobiluncus* spp., and other anaerobic bacteria
        *   **Motile curved rods:** *Mobiluncus* species may be seen
    *   **Sensitivity:** Moderate to high sensitivity, especially for detecting clue cells
    *   **Interpretation**
        *   Nugent Score: Gram stain is used to score bacteria (0-10) based on the presence of *Lactobacilli* and *Gardnerella vaginalis*

### **Gram Stain (Nugent Score)** {-}
*   **Procedure:** A Gram stain is performed on a smear of vaginal discharge
*   **Visualization:** The bacterial morphotypes are scored based on the presence of *Lactobacillus* spp., *Gardnerella vaginalis*, and curved Gram-variable or Gram-negative rods (*Mobiluncus* spp.)
*   **Scoring:** The Nugent score is calculated based on the relative abundance of these bacteria. A score of 0-3 is considered normal, 4-6 is intermediate, and 7-10 is diagnostic of BV
*   **Sensitivity:** High
*   **Specificity:** High

### **Culture** {-}
*   **Procedure:** Culture is not routinely used for the diagnosis of BV
*   **Disadvantage:** Culturing the multiple organisms is not practical

### **Other Tests** {-}
*   **Commercial Tests:** Some commercial tests are available to detect specific BV-associated organisms (e.g., *G. vaginalis*)
*   **DNA Probe Tests:** Tests that detect BV-associated organisms by DNA probe or nucleic acid amplification tests

## **Key Considerations** {-}
*   **Specimen Collection:** Proper specimen collection is essential for accurate results. Swabs must be collected from the vaginal walls and transported in appropriate transport media
*   **Quality Control:** Strict quality control measures should be in place to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the laboratory tests
*   **Correlation with Clinical Findings:** Laboratory results must always be interpreted in conjunction with the patient's clinical presentation, symptoms, and other relevant information
*   **Sensitivity and Specificity:** The sensitivity and specificity of each test vary. The choice of test depends on the clinical situation, the availability of resources, and the desired level of accuracy
*   **Point-of-Care Testing (POCT):** Some rapid tests are available for use at the point of care, allowing for rapid diagnosis and treatment
*   **Reporting:** The laboratory report should include the results of all tests performed, along with any relevant interpretive comments
*   **Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing:** Antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not routinely performed for *T. vaginalis* or *Candida* spp
*   **Follow-up:** In some cases, follow-up testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis or to monitor the response to treatment
