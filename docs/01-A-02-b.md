# Blood Culture {-}

Blood culture collection is a critical procedure in diagnosing bloodstream infections. It requires meticulous attention to detail to prevent contamination and ensure accurate results

## **Importance** {-}

*   **Diagnosing Bacteremia/Fungemia:** Blood cultures are the gold standard for detecting bacteria or fungi in the bloodstream, which can cause severe infections like sepsis
*   **Guiding Treatment:** Identifying the causative organism and its antibiotic sensitivities is crucial for selecting the appropriate antimicrobial therapy
*   **Monitoring Infection Control:** Blood culture results help track and manage healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), contributing to infection control efforts
*   **Preventing False Positives:** Contamination during collection can lead to false-positive results, resulting in unnecessary antibiotic use, prolonged hospital stays, and increased healthcare costs

## **Key Principles** {-}

*   **Sterile Technique:** Strict adherence to sterile technique is paramount to minimize the risk of contamination
*   **Skin Antisepsis:** Thorough disinfection of the venipuncture site is crucial to eliminate skin flora that can contaminate the blood sample
*   **Blood Volume:** Collecting the appropriate volume of blood is essential for optimal recovery of microorganisms
*   **Collection Timing:** Ideally, blood cultures should be collected before starting antibiotic therapy and when the patient is experiencing signs and symptoms of infection
*   **Number of Sets:** Collecting multiple blood culture sets (usually two or three) increases the sensitivity of detection

## **Materials and Equipment** {-}

*   **Blood Culture Bottles**
    *   **Aerobic Bottle:** For the growth of aerobic bacteria
    *   **Anaerobic Bottle:** For the growth of anaerobic bacteria
    *   **Pediatric Bottle:** For smaller blood volumes from pediatric patients
*   **Antiseptic Solutions**
    *   **Chlorhexidine Gluconate:** A commonly used antiseptic with broad-spectrum activity
    *   **Iodine/Iodophor:** Another effective antiseptic
    *   **Alcohol (70% Isopropyl):** Used for initial skin cleaning
*   **Sterile Gloves:** To protect the healthcare worker and maintain sterility
*   **Tourniquet:** To distend the veins for easier venipuncture
*   **Sterile Needles and Syringes or Blood Collection Sets**
    *   **Needles:** Typically 21-23 gauge
    *   **Syringes:** Appropriate size for the required blood volume
    *   **Blood Collection Sets (Butterfly Needles):** Often used for patients with difficult veins
*   **Sterile Gauze Pads:** For cleaning and applying pressure after venipuncture
*   **Bandage:** To cover the venipuncture site
*   **Sharps Container:** For safe disposal of used needles and syringes
*   **Blood Culture Collection Tray:** To organize supplies

## **Procedure** {-}

1.  **Preparation**
    *   Review the physician's order and verify the patient's identity using two identifiers
    *   Explain the procedure to the patient
    *   Gather all necessary supplies and equipment
    *   Perform hand hygiene
    *   Don sterile gloves

2.  **Site Selection**
    *   Choose a venipuncture site that is free from lesions, scars, or hematomas
    *   Avoid drawing blood from an IV line unless specifically ordered by the physician

3.  **Skin Antisepsis**
    *   Apply the tourniquet
    *   Clean the venipuncture site with 70% isopropyl alcohol, using a circular motion, starting from the center and moving outward. Allow to air dry completely (at least 30 seconds)
    *   Apply chlorhexidine gluconate or iodine/iodophor using a similar circular motion. Allow to air dry completely (at least 30 seconds)
        *   **Important:** Do not touch the disinfected site after cleaning. If you need to palpate the vein again, you must repeat the disinfection process

4.  **Blood Collection**
    *   Perform venipuncture using sterile technique
    *   Collect the appropriate volume of blood into the syringe or blood collection set
        *   **Adults:** Typically 8-10 mL per bottle (aerobic and anaerobic). Follow bottle manufacturer's instructions
        *   **Pediatrics:** Volume depends on the age and weight of the child. Follow bottle manufacturer's instructions
    *   Release the tourniquet
    *   Apply pressure to the venipuncture site with sterile gauze
    *   Engage safety device and dispose of the needle and syringe or blood collection set in the sharps container

5.  **Inoculation of Blood Culture Bottles**
    *   Clean the tops of the blood culture bottles with alcohol swabs
    *   Inoculate the blood culture bottles in the correct order (anaerobic first, if using a butterfly needle)
    *   Mix the blood with the culture media by gently inverting the bottles several times
    *   **Important:** Do not overfill or underfill the blood culture bottles. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for the correct blood-to-broth ratio

6.  **Post-Collection**
    *   Apply a bandage to the venipuncture site
    *   Label the blood culture bottles with the patient's information, date, time, and initials of the person collecting the sample
    *   Transport the blood culture bottles to the laboratory promptly

## **Specific Considerations** {-}

*   **Collection from IV Lines**
    *   Blood cultures should ideally be collected by venipuncture, not from IV lines, due to the increased risk of contamination
    *   If blood cultures must be collected from an IV line, follow a strict protocol, including:
        *   Disinfecting the IV port thoroughly with alcohol and chlorhexidine
        *   Discarding the initial aliquot of blood
*   **Patients on Antibiotics**
    *   If possible, collect blood cultures before starting antibiotic therapy
    *   If the patient is already on antibiotics, note this on the requisition form. The lab may use special media to neutralize the antibiotics
*   **Pediatric Blood Cultures**
    *   Use pediatric blood culture bottles designed for smaller blood volumes
    *   Follow specific guidelines for blood volume based on the child's age and weight

## **Common Errors and How to Avoid Them** {-}

*   **Inadequate Skin Antisepsis**
    *   *Solution:* Emphasize the importance of proper skin preparation techniques, including the use of appropriate antiseptics and sufficient drying time
*   **Contamination**
    *   *Solution:* Reinforce sterile technique principles, including hand hygiene, sterile gloves, and avoiding touching the venipuncture site after disinfection
*   **Insufficient Blood Volume**
    *   *Solution:* Provide clear guidelines on the correct blood volume for each type of blood culture bottle and patient population
*   **Improper Inoculation Technique**
    *   *Solution:* Train personnel on the correct order of inoculation, mixing techniques, and avoiding overfilling or underfilling the bottles

## **Documentation and Quality Control** {-}

*   **Documentation**
    *   Record the date and time of collection, the site of venipuncture, the volume of blood collected, the lot numbers of the blood culture bottles, and any deviations from standard procedure
*   **Quality Control**
    *   Monitor contamination rates and investigate any trends or patterns
    *   Provide ongoing training and education to personnel on blood culture collection techniques
    *   Periodically review and update blood culture collection protocols to ensure they are consistent with current best practices
    *   Participate in proficiency testing programs to assess the accuracy of blood culture collection procedures
