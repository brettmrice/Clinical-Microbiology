# Skin Flora {-}

The skin is the body's primary barrier, and it is colonized by a diverse population of microorganisms. Understanding skin flora and their potential roles in bloodstream infections and bone marrow infections is crucial for interpreting culture results and managing patient care

## **Normal Skin Flora** {-}

*   **Composition:** The skin flora is a complex and dynamic community of bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The composition varies based on factors like:
    *   **Anatomic Site:** Different areas of the skin have different conditions (moisture, sebum production, etc.) influencing which microbes thrive
    *   **Age:** Flora changes throughout life
    *   **Environmental Exposure:** Factors like hygiene, contact with other individuals, and exposure to environmental microbes
*   **Predominant Organisms**
    *   **Gram-Positive Bacteria**
        *   **Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci (CoNS):** *Staphylococcus epidermidis* is the most abundant. Other CoNS include *S. haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. capitis, S. lugdunensis*
        *   *Staphylococcus aureus:** Found on the skin of some individuals. Can colonize the anterior nares
        *   *Corynebacterium spp.:* (diphtheroids). Includes *C. xerosis, C. striatum, C. jeikeium*
        *   *Micrococcus spp.*
        *   *Propionibacterium acnes* (Cutibacterium acnes): Commonly found in hair follicles and associated with acne
        *   *Bacillus spp.*
        *   *Enterococcus spp.:* Can be transient colonizers
    *   **Gram-Negative Bacteria**
        *   *Acinetobacter spp.:* Can colonize the skin, especially in healthcare settings
        *   *Klebsiella spp.*
        *   *Pseudomonas spp.*
        *   *Moraxella spp.*
    *   **Fungi**
        *   *Malassezia spp.:* Yeast, often associated with seborrheic dermatitis
        *   *Candida spp.:* Usually present in low numbers

## **Role of Skin Flora in Bloodstream and Bone Marrow Infections** {-}

*   **Contamination vs. Infection:** Differentiating between skin flora contamination and true infection is a critical step in interpreting blood culture results
*   **Contamination**
    *   **Source:** Skin flora organisms can contaminate blood culture samples during collection. This is more common when aseptic technique is not strictly followed
    *   **Appearance:** Contaminants are typically low in number and may be the only organism isolated from one blood culture set
    *   **Common Contaminants:** CoNS (especially *S. epidermidis*), *Corynebacterium spp.*, *Bacillus spp.*
    *   **Clinical Significance:** In the absence of clinical signs of infection (e.g., fever, chills, signs of sepsis) and in the absence of isolation from multiple blood culture sets, contamination is the most likely explanation
*   **Skin Flora as Pathogens**
    *   **Entry Points:** Bacteria from the skin can enter the bloodstream through various routes
        *   **Catheters and Intravascular Devices:** A major risk factor for bacteremia and sepsis. Organisms can colonize the catheter and then enter the bloodstream. A major route of infection is along the external surface of the catheter
        *   **Skin Wounds and Trauma:** Breaks in the skin barrier provide opportunities for entry
        *   **Invasive Procedures:** Surgical procedures, dental procedures, and other invasive interventions can introduce organisms into the bloodstream
        *   **Indwelling Medical Devices:** Intravenous catheters, central lines, and other indwelling devices create an entry point for skin flora to enter the bloodstream
    *   **Organisms of Clinical Significance**
        *   **CoNS:** The most common cause of catheter-related bloodstream infections, especially *S. epidermidis*. Can also cause endocarditis and other infections. Often resistant to multiple antibiotics
        *   *Staphylococcus aureus:* Can cause a wide range of infections, including bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. Virulent pathogen
        *   *Corynebacterium spp.:* Can cause bloodstream infections, especially in immunocompromised patients or those with central lines
        *   *Cutibacterium acnes:* Can cause bloodstream infections, particularly in patients with prosthetic devices
        *   *Bacillus spp.:* Uncommon cause of bacteremia, but can occur, especially in immunocompromised patients

## **Clinical Significance and Interpretation** {-}

*   **Key Factors**
    *   **Number of Positive Cultures:** Isolation of the same organism from multiple blood culture sets *strongly* suggests a true infection, regardless of whether it is a skin flora organism
    *   **Clinical Presentation:** Presence or absence of symptoms (e.g., fever, chills, hypotension, altered mental status, and signs of local infection) is critical for assessing the significance of a positive blood culture
    *   **Other Laboratory Results:** Elevated white blood cell count, elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., CRP, procalcitonin), and abnormal organ function tests support the diagnosis of a bloodstream infection
    *   **Antimicrobial Therapy:** If the patient is already on antibiotics, the presence of an organism in the blood culture suggests that the therapy is ineffective or that there is a secondary infection
    *   **Source of Infection:** Consider the presence of intravascular devices, skin wounds, or other potential sources of infection
*   **Interpretation Guidelines**
    *   **CoNS Isolation**
        *   **Single positive blood culture:** More likely to be contamination, unless the patient has a clear clinical picture of infection, or is immunocompromised
        *   **Multiple positive blood cultures:** High probability of bloodstream infection, especially if the patient has an intravascular device
        *   **Isolation from a catheter tip:** Supports the diagnosis of catheter-related bloodstream infection
    *   **Staphylococcus aureus Isolation:** Always considered a pathogen. Should be taken very seriously
    *   **Corynebacterium spp. and Bacillus spp. Isolation:** Assess clinical correlation. More likely to be pathogenic in patients with indwelling devices, central lines, or immunocompromised
    *   **Prompt Reporting:** All positive blood cultures should be promptly reported to the physician, along with Gram stain results and preliminary identification

## **Aseptic Technique and Specimen Collection** {-}

*   **Meticulous Aseptic Technique:** The single most important factor in reducing the risk of contamination
    *   **Site Preparation:** Prepare the venipuncture site thoroughly with antiseptic solution (e.g., 70% isopropyl alcohol followed by Chloraprep or povidone-iodine), allowing adequate dry time
    *   **Blood Collection:** Avoid touching the venipuncture site
    *   **Equipment Sterility:** Use sterile needles and syringes
*   **Blood Culture Bottles**
    *   **Disinfect bottle tops:** Before inoculating blood culture bottles, disinfect the rubber stoppers with 70% alcohol to avoid contamination
    *   **Proper Collection Volumes:** Collect the appropriate volume of blood, as indicated in your procedures
*   **Catheter-Associated Infections**
    *   **Collect from multiple sites:** Collect blood cultures from both the catheter and a peripheral site
    *   **Catheter Removal and Tip Culture:** If the catheter is being removed, send the catheter tip for culture
