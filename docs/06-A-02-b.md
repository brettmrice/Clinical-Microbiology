# Dimorphic Fungi {-}

Those shape-shifting organisms that can exist as molds in the environment and as yeasts or spherules in the body! We'll cover the major players: *Histoplasma capsulatum*, *Blastomyces*, *Coccidioides*, and *Sporothrix schenckii*, focusing on their disease states, how they spread, and how we identify them in the lab

## **Dimorphic Fungi** {-}

*   **Definition:** Dimorphic fungi are those that exhibit two distinct morphological forms depending on environmental conditions, primarily temperature
    *   **Mold Form:** In the environment (soil, decaying vegetation), they grow as filamentous molds with hyphae and conidia
    *   **Tissue Form:** In the human body (at body temperature), they transform into a different form, typically yeasts or spherules
*   **Infection Mechanism:** Humans typically acquire these infections by inhaling the mold form's conidia from the environment
*   **Geographic Distribution:** Each dimorphic fungus has a characteristic geographic distribution, which is important to consider when evaluating patients
*   **Key Genera:** We'll focus on *Histoplasma*, *Blastomyces*, *Coccidioides*, and *Sporothrix*, which are the most clinically significant dimorphic fungal pathogens
