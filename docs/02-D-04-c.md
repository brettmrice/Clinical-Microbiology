# Cystic fibrosis {-}

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that significantly affects the lungs, making patients highly susceptible to chronic and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections. Identifying the pathogens, along with their antibiotic resistance profiles, is crucial for guiding targeted therapy and managing pulmonary complications. Proper analysis is vital

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Chronic Infections:** Individuals with CF often experience chronic, polymicrobial infections
*   **Pathogens and Pathogenesis:** *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is the most common, but other organisms also play important roles
*   **Specimen Sources:** Sputum, BAL, and tracheal aspirates are often collected
*   **Specimen Processing:** A thorough assessment is required
    *   **Sputum Quality:** Assessment is critical. The presence of increased inflammatory cells is expected
    *   **Culture on Appropriate Media:** BAP, CHOC, selective media
*   **Identification and Reporting:** Timely identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing are essential for patient management
*   **Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing:** Performing tests to detect resistance

## **Major Pathogens: Colony Morphology, Gram Stain, and Identification** {-}

### ***Staphylococcus aureus*** {-}
*   **Source:** Sputum, BAL
*   **Colony Morphology**
    *   **BAP:** Medium to large, circular, opaque, smooth, golden-yellow or cream-colored colonies
    *   **Hemolysis:** Usually beta-hemolytic
*   **Gram Stain:** Gram-positive cocci in clusters
*   **Identification**
    *   **Catalase:** Positive
    *   **Coagulase:** Positive
*   **Significance:** *S. aureus* is an early colonizer and common cause of acute exacerbations in CF patients. It can be particularly virulent, and has been associated with MRSA

### ***Pseudomonas aeruginosa*** {-}
*   **Source:** Sputum, BAL
*   **Colony Morphology**
    *   **BAP:** Large, flat, spreading colonies
    *   **Pigment Production:** Often produces a blue-green pigment (*pyocyanin*) and/or a yellow pigment (*pyoverdine*)
    *   **Appearance:** Can have a distinct fruity odor (grape-like)
*   **Gram Stain:** Gram-negative rods
*   **Identification**
    *   **Oxidase:** Positive
    *   **Glucose Fermentation:** Oxidative (uses glucose but does not ferment it)
    *   **Motility:** Motile
    *   **Commercial Identification Systems:** *P. aeruginosa* is the most commonly found, and is often multi-drug resistant. Chronic infections can lead to mucoid strains

### ***Haemophilus influenzae*** {-}
*   **Source:** Sputum, BAL
*   **Colony Morphology**
    *   **CHOC:** Small, gray, translucent, slightly mucoid colonies. "Mousy" odor
    *   **BAP:** Will only grow with V factor (NAD) and X factor (hemin)
*   **Gram Stain:** Gram-negative coccobacilli or pleomorphic rods
*   **Identification**
    *   **X and V Factor Requirement:** Requires both X factor (hemin) and V factor (NAD) for growth (use of factor strips or a quad plate)
    *   **Commercial Identification Systems**
*   **Significance:** *H. influenzae* can cause exacerbations

### ***Burkholderia cepacia* Complex (Bcc)** {-}
*   **Source:** Sputum, BAL
*   **Colony Morphology**
    *   **BAP:** Variable. Often non-pigmented or yellow colonies
    *   **Appearance:** Can have a characteristic onion-like odor
*   **Gram Stain:** Gram-negative rods
*   **Identification**
    *   **Oxidase:** Positive
    *   **Glucose Fermentation:** Oxidative
    *   **Motility:** Motile
    *   **Commercial Identification Systems:** Identification is important for *Bcc*. The identification is species-level
*   **Significance:** *Bcc* can cause severe pulmonary decline and can be transmitted between CF patients

## **Additional Considerations** {-}

*   **Polymicrobial Infections:** The infections are often caused by multiple organisms
*   **Mucoid Strains:** *P. aeruginosa* and other organisms can develop mucoid strains due to the production of alginate, which contributes to biofilm formation
*   **Antibiotic Resistance:** Common, often to multiple antibiotics, which leads to challenges
*   **Treatment:** Must be tailored to the specific organism and the antibiotic susceptibility
*   **Reporting**
    *   Organisms that are isolated
    *   Antibiotic resistance profiles

## **Key Terms** {-}
