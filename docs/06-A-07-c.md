# Intrinsic Resistance {-}

Certain fungi exhibit intrinsic resistance to specific antifungal agents, meaning they are inherently resistant to those drugs regardless of prior exposure. Recognizing these patterns is crucial for selecting appropriate antifungal therapy from the outset. We'll explore the concept of intrinsic resistance and highlight key examples, focusing on *Candida krusei* and other notable cases

## **Intrinsic Resistance** {-}

*   **Definition:** Intrinsic resistance refers to the inherent resistance of a microorganism to a particular antimicrobial agent, regardless of prior exposure to the drug. This resistance is due to the organism's genetic makeup and is not acquired through mutation or horizontal gene transfer
*   **Importance:** Recognizing intrinsic resistance patterns is essential for:
    *   Selecting appropriate initial antifungal therapy
    *   Avoiding unnecessary use of ineffective agents
    *   Preventing treatment failure
    *   Guiding antifungal stewardship efforts
*   **Mechanisms:** Intrinsic resistance can arise from various mechanisms, including:
    *   **Target Modification:** The fungal target of the antifungal agent may be structurally different in intrinsically resistant species, preventing the drug from binding effectively
    *   **Reduced Permeability:** The fungal cell wall or membrane may be less permeable to the antifungal agent, limiting its entry into the cell
    *   **Efflux Pumps:** The fungus may possess efflux pumps that actively transport the antifungal agent out of the cell, reducing its intracellular concentration
    *   **Enzymatic Inactivation:** The fungus may produce enzymes that inactivate the antifungal agent

## **Key Examples of Intrinsic Resistance** {-}

### ***Candida krusei*** {-}

*   **Intrinsic Resistance:** Fluconazole
*   **Clinical Significance:** *Candida krusei* is intrinsically resistant to fluconazole, a commonly used antifungal agent. This means that fluconazole should not be used to treat infections caused by *C. krusei*
*   **Alternative Agents:** Alternative antifungal agents that are typically effective against *C. krusei* include:
    *   Echinocandins (e.g., caspofungin, micafungin, anidulafungin)
    *   Voriconazole
    *   Amphotericin B

### ***Candida glabrata*** {-}

*   **Intrinsic Resistance:** Although not completely resistant, *Candida glabrata* often exhibits reduced susceptibility to azoles, particularly fluconazole. It also has a propensity to develop acquired resistance to azoles during treatment
*   **Clinical Significance:** Infections caused by *C. glabrata* may require higher doses of azoles or alternative antifungal agents
*   **Alternative Agents:**
    *   Echinocandins
    *   Amphotericin B
    *   Voriconazole (may be effective at higher doses)

### ***Candida auris*** {-}

*   **Intrinsic Resistance:** *Candida auris* exhibits variable susceptibility to azoles, amphotericin B, and echinocandins, and multidrug-resistant strains are increasingly common
*   **Clinical Significance:** Infections caused by *C. auris* can be difficult to treat due to its resistance to multiple antifungal agents
*   **Treatment:** Treatment decisions should be guided by antifungal susceptibility testing results. Combination therapy may be necessary for multidrug-resistant strains

### ***Scedosporium spp.*** {-}

*   **Intrinsic Resistance:** *Scedosporium* species are often resistant to amphotericin B and many azoles
*   **Clinical Significance:** Infections caused by *Scedosporium* can be difficult to treat due to their resistance to commonly used antifungal agents
*   **Treatment:** Voriconazole is often the preferred agent, but susceptibility testing is essential to guide therapy. Other options include posaconazole and isavuconazole

### ***Fusarium spp.*** {-}

*   **Intrinsic Resistance:** *Fusarium* species exhibit variable susceptibility to antifungal agents, but they are often resistant to amphotericin B and many azoles
*   **Clinical Significance:** Infections caused by *Fusarium* can be difficult to treat due to their resistance to commonly used antifungal agents
*   **Treatment:** Voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole may be effective, but susceptibility testing is essential to guide therapy. Combination therapy may be necessary

### ***Mucorales (Zygomycetes)*** {-}

*   **Intrinsic Resistance:** Mucorales are intrinsically resistant to voriconazole
*   **Clinical Significance:** Voriconazole should not be used to treat mucormycosis
*   **Alternative Agents:**
    *   Amphotericin B (especially liposomal amphotericin B)
    *   Posaconazole
    *   Isavuconazole

## **Laboratory Considerations** {-}

*   **Antifungal Susceptibility Testing:** It is essential to perform antifungal susceptibility testing on clinically significant fungal isolates to guide therapy and detect resistance
*   **Quality Control:** Ensure that antifungal susceptibility testing methods are properly validated and that quality control procedures are followed
*   **Reporting:** Report antifungal susceptibility testing results accurately and include interpretive comments to guide clinical decision-making
*   **Communication:** Communicate with clinicians about intrinsic resistance patterns and the implications for antifungal therapy
