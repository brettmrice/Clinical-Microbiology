# Cervical Cancer {-}

This section focuses on the role of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer screening, including the etiology, epidemiology, transmission, and disease states associated with HPV infections

## **Human Papillomavirus (HPV)** {-}

### **Etiology** {-}
*   **Classification:** A member of the *Papillomaviridae* family
*   **Types:** Over 200 types of HPV have been identified, with approximately 40 types infecting the genital area. These are broadly classified as:
    *   **High-Risk HPV Types:** Associated with cervical cancer and other cancers (e.g., anal, oropharyngeal, vaginal, vulvar, penile). The most common high-risk types are HPV 16 and HPV 18, which account for approximately 70% of cervical cancers
    *   **Low-Risk HPV Types:** Typically cause genital warts (condylomata acuminata) but are not associated with cancer. The most common low-risk types are HPV 6 and HPV 11

### **Epidemiology** {-}
*   **Global Distribution:** HPV is found worldwide
*   **Prevalence:** Extremely common, with most sexually active individuals acquiring an HPV infection at some point in their lives
*   **Age Groups:** Most infections occur in adolescents and young adults shortly after the onset of sexual activity

### **Transmission** {-}
*   **Sexual Contact:** Primarily transmitted through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex
*   **Skin-to-Skin Contact:** Can also be transmitted through non-penetrative skin-to-skin contact in the genital area
*   **Mother to Child:** Rarely transmitted from mother to child during childbirth

### **Disease States** {-}
*   **Genital Warts (Condylomata Acuminata):** Caused by low-risk HPV types (e.g., HPV 6 and HPV 11). These are benign growths on the genitals, anus, or surrounding skin
*   **Cervical Dysplasia (Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia, CIN):** Precancerous changes in the cells of the cervix caused by high-risk HPV types. Classified as:
    *   **CIN 1:** Mild dysplasia, often resolves spontaneously
    *   **CIN 2:** Moderate dysplasia, higher risk of progressing to cancer
    *   **CIN 3:** Severe dysplasia, high risk of progressing to cancer
*   **Cervical Cancer:** Invasive cancer of the cervix caused by persistent infection with high-risk HPV types
    *   **Types:** Most cervical cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, but adenocarcinoma is also common
*   **Other Cancers:** High-risk HPV types are also associated with anal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer (cancer of the throat and tonsils), vaginal cancer, vulvar cancer, and penile cancer

### **Cervical Cancer Screening** {-}
*   **Purpose:** To detect precancerous changes in the cervix before they progress to invasive cancer
*   **Methods**
    *   **Pap Test (Papanicolaou Test):** Collects cells from the cervix to be examined under a microscope for abnormalities
    *   **HPV Test:** Detects the presence of high-risk HPV types in cervical cells
*   **Screening Guidelines:** Vary by age and risk factors, but generally recommend:
    *   **Ages 21-29:** Pap test every 3 years
    *   **Ages 30-65**
        *   Pap test every 3 years
        *   HPV test every 5 years
        *   Co-testing (Pap test and HPV test together) every 5 years
    *   **Over 65:** Screening is typically not needed if previous screenings have been normal
*   **Follow-up**
    *   **Abnormal Pap Test:** May require repeat testing, colposcopy (examination of the cervix with a magnifying instrument), or biopsy
    *   **Positive HPV Test:** May require repeat testing, colposcopy, or genotyping to identify specific high-risk HPV types

### **Prevention** {-}
*   **HPV Vaccine:** Highly effective in preventing infection with high-risk HPV types. Recommended for:
    *   **Adolescents:** Ideally administered before the onset of sexual activity (ages 11-12)
    *   **Young Adults:** Can be administered up to age 26, and in some cases up to age 45
*   **Safe Sex Practices:** Using condoms can reduce the risk of HPV transmission, but they do not provide complete protection
*   **Regular Screening:** Following recommended cervical cancer screening guidelines can detect precancerous changes early

## **Important Notes** {-}

*   **Persistent HPV Infection:** Most HPV infections are cleared by the immune system within 1-2 years. Persistent infection with high-risk HPV types is the primary risk factor for cervical cancer
*   **Risk Factors for Cervical Cancer:** Persistent HPV infection, smoking, weakened immune system, multiple sexual partners, and long-term use of oral contraceptives
*   **Early Detection is Key:** Regular cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination are essential for preventing cervical cancer

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Etiology:** The cause or origin of a disease or condition
*   **Epidemiology:** The study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the control of health problems
*   **Transmission:** The way a disease is spread from one person or source to another
*   **High-Risk HPV Types:** HPV types associated with cervical cancer and other cancers
*   **Low-Risk HPV Types:** HPV types that typically cause genital warts but are not associated with cancer
*   **Genital Warts (Condylomata Acuminata):** Benign growths on the genitals, anus, or surrounding skin
*   **Cervical Dysplasia (Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia, CIN):** Precancerous changes in the cells of the cervix
*   **Cervical Cancer:** Invasive cancer of the cervix
*   **Pap Test (Papanicolaou Test):** A screening test that collects cells from the cervix to be examined under a microscope for abnormalities
*   **HPV Test:** A screening test that detects the presence of high-risk HPV types in cervical cells
*   **Colposcopy:** Examination of the cervix with a magnifying instrument
*   **Biopsy:** Removal of a tissue sample for microscopic examination
*   **HPV Vaccine:** A vaccine that prevents infection with high-risk HPV types
*   **Persistent Infection:** An infection that does not clear on its own and continues to be present over time
