# Yeast {-}

This section will explore the major players like *Candida*, *Cryptococcus*, and *Malassezia*, focusing on the diseases they cause, their origins, how they spread, and the lab techniques we use to identify them

## **Yeast Pathogens** {-}

*   **Ubiquitous Nature:** Yeasts are single-celled fungi found everywhere â€“ in the environment, on our skin, and in our bodies. Most are harmless, but some can cause serious infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals
*   **Opportunistic Infections:** Many yeast infections are opportunistic, meaning they occur when the immune system is weakened or the normal balance of microorganisms in the body is disrupted
*   **Key Genera:** We'll focus on *Candida*, *Cryptococcus*, and *Malassezia*, which are the most clinically significant yeast pathogens

## **Candida spp.** {-}
