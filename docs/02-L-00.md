# MRSA/MSSA, VRE, ESBL/CRE {-}

This section covers the essential components of the laboratory workflow for detecting and characterizing these clinically significant organisms and resistance markers

##  **Specimen Sources** {-}

The choice of specimen source is critical for accurate and timely detection. The selection depends on the suspected site of colonization or infection and the patient's risk factors

**MRSA/MSSA**

*   **Primary:** Nasal swabs (most common screening site)
*   **Secondary:** Wound swabs, perineal swabs, other sites based on clinical suspicion (e.g., indwelling catheters)

**VRE**

*   **Primary:** Rectal swabs (GI tract as a primary reservoir)
*   **Secondary:** Stool samples, wound swabs, urine (if UTI is suspected)

**ESBL/CRE**

*   **Primary:** Rectal swabs (GI tract as a primary reservoir)
*   **Secondary:** Stool samples, wound swabs, urine (if UTI suspected), respiratory specimens (if pneumonia), blood cultures (if bacteremia/sepsis)

**Common Considerations**

*   Patient risk factors (healthcare exposure, antibiotic use, prior colonization/infection, indwelling devices)
*   Proper collection technique to minimize contamination
*   Appropriate labeling and transport to maintain specimen integrity

##  **Culture Methods** {-}

Culture methods are still essential for isolating and identifying the organisms, as well as performing susceptibility testing

**MRSA/MSSA**

*   **Selective Media**
    *   Chromogenic media (color-coded colonies)
    *   Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA)
*   **Non-Selective Media:** Blood Agar Plate (BAP)
*   **Identification**
    *   Colony morphology on BAP (creamy, golden)
    *   Gram stain (Gram-positive cocci in clusters)
    *   Coagulase test (to differentiate *S. aureus*)
    *   Oxacillin/Cefoxitin disk diffusion (to detect methicillin resistance)
    *   Latex agglutination (to detect PBP2a or confirm *S. aureus*)

**VRE**

*   **Selective Media**
    *   Bile Esculin Agar (BEA) with Vancomycin
    *   Chromogenic media
*   **Identification**
    *   Colony morphology on BAP or BEA (small, white/gray)
    *   Gram stain (Gram-positive cocci in pairs/short chains)
    *   Catalase test (negative)
    *   Vancomycin susceptibility testing (to confirm resistance)

**ESBL/CRE**

*   **Selective Media**
    *   Chromogenic media (color-coded colonies)
    *   MacConkey Agar
*   **Identification**
    *   Colony morphology (variable, depends on organism)
    *   Gram stain (Gram-negative bacilli)
    *   Automated identification and susceptibility testing (e.g., Vitek, Phoenix)
    *   Modified Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion (ESBL detection)
    *   Phenotypic tests (e.g., double-disk synergy for ESBL; Modified Hodge test, Carba NP for carbapenemases)

##  **Molecular Methods** {-}

Molecular methods offer rapid and sensitive detection of resistance genes, often directly from clinical specimens

**MRSA/MSSA**

*   **Target:** *mecA* gene
*   **Methods**
    *   Real-Time PCR (qPCR) (most common)
    *   Conventional PCR
    *   Isothermal amplification (LAMP)
    *   Molecular hybridization

**VRE**

*   **Target:** *vanA*, *vanB*, or other *van* genes
*   **Methods**
    *   Real-Time PCR (qPCR)
    *   Conventional PCR
    *   Isothermal amplification (LAMP)
    *   Molecular hybridization

**ESBL/CRE**

*   **Targets:** Genes encoding ESBLs (e.g., *blaCTX-M*, *blaTEM*, *blaSHV*) and carbapenemases (e.g., *blaKPC*, *blaOXA-48*, *blaNDM*)
*   **Methods**
    *   Real-Time PCR (qPCR) (often multiplex)
    *   Conventional PCR
    *   Multiplex PCR
    *   Microarrays
    *   Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

**General Considerations** {-}

*   **Advantages:** Rapid, sensitive, specific, direct detection
*   **Disadvantages:** Cost, equipment/expertise, potential for false positives, and limited to the targets of the assay
*   **Quality Control:** Positive/negative controls, internal controls, validation
*   **Interpretation:** Detects the presence of resistance genes, phenotypic confirmation is often needed
