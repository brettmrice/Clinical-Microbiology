# Molecular Methods {-}

Antigen detection and molecular methods have revolutionized the diagnosis of upper respiratory tract (URT) infections, offering significant advantages over traditional culture-based techniques, particularly for specific pathogens such as *Streptococcus pyogenes* (GAS) and *Bordetella pertussis*. These methods provide rapid results, which is critical for treatment and preventing the spread of contagious diseases

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Rapid Diagnosis:** Fast results are important. These tests give results in a matter of minutes or hours
*   **Enhanced Sensitivity and Specificity:** PCR is very good
*   **Utility:** Helpful when culture may be slow
*   **Antimicrobial Stewardship:** Guides appropriate antibiotic use
*   **Specimen Types:** Throat swabs, NP swabs
*   **Limitations:** Cost, possible false negatives
*   **Quality Control:** Necessary procedures

## **Antigen Detection Methods** {-}

### ***Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A Streptococcus, GAS)} {-}

*   **Purpose:** Rapid detection of GAS antigens from throat swabs
*   **Principle:** Antibodies react with GAS antigens
*   **Types of Tests**
    *   **Lateral Flow Immunoassays:** Simple, results in minutes. (e.g., immunochromatographic assays)
    *   **Enzyme Immunoassays (EIAs):** More sensitive and can be automated
*   **Procedure**
    *   **Specimen Preparation:** Throat swab is collected
    *   **Testing:** Follow the manufacturer's instructions
    *   **Result Interpretation:** A positive result indicates the presence of GAS antigens, and that treatment is needed
*   **Advantages**
    *   Rapid, easy to perform
    *   Relatively inexpensive
*   **Disadvantages**
    *   Lower sensitivity than culture
    *   False negatives
*   **Clinical Application:** Use to rule in GAS pharyngitis, and help with treatment

### ***Bordetella pertussis*** {-}

*   **Purpose:** To identify *Bordetella pertussis*
*   **Types of Tests:** Enzyme immunoassays
*   **Procedure:** NP swab. Test is done according to the manufacturer's instructions
*   **Advantages:** Rapid
*   **Disadvantages:** Lower sensitivity than PCR
*   **Application:** Diagnose *Bordetella pertussis*

### ***Bordetella pertussis*** {-}

*   **Purpose:** Detection of *B. pertussis* DNA
*   **Method**
    *   **PCR:** The specific genes are amplified
    *   **Real-time PCR:** Quantifies the amount of DNA
*   **Procedure**
    *   **Specimen Preparation:** DNA is extracted from the NP swab
    *   **Amplification:** PCR is performed
    *   **Detection and result interpretation**
*   **Advantages**
    *   High sensitivity and specificity
    *   Rapid results
*   **Disadvantages**
    *   Cost, expertise
*   **Clinical Application:** Used in difficult cases. Confirm the diagnosis

## **Additional Considerations** {-}

*   **Specimen Collection:** Collection is critical. Proper collection helps with an accurate diagnosis
*   **Interpretation of Results:** The result must be looked at in the clinical context
*   **Reporting:** Prompt reporting is needed
*   **Limitations:** These tests have specific limitations
