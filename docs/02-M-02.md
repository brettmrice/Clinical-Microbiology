*   **Documentation:** Thoroughly document all procedures, results, and communications
*   **Training and Competency:** Ensure that all personnel are properly trained and demonstrate competency in the procedures
*   **Emerging Technologies:** Be aware of and adopt new technologies (e.g., MALDI-TOF MS) for improved identification and characterization

##  **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Bioterrorism Agent:** A biological agent (bacteria, virus, toxin, etc.) intentionally used to cause harm or death to humans, animals, or plants. These agents are often chosen for their ease of production, dissemination, and potential for causing widespread illness or panic
*   **BSL-3 Laboratory:** A laboratory designed to handle infectious agents that can cause serious or potentially lethal disease through aerosol transmission. This requires specific engineering controls (e.g., directional airflow, sealed windows/doors), specialized equipment (e.g., biosafety cabinets), and stringent safety practices
*   **Select Agent:** A biological agent or toxin that has been identified by the U.S. government as posing a severe threat to public health and safety, animal or plant health, or to the safety of animal or plant products. Handling, storage, and transfer of Select Agents are strictly regulated
*   **Colony Morphology:** The visual characteristics of bacterial colonies grown on solid media, including size, shape, color, texture, edge, and elevation. These characteristics provide valuable clues for presumptive identification
*   **Gram Stain:** A differential staining technique used to classify bacteria based on their cell wall structure. Gram-positive bacteria stain purple, while Gram-negative bacteria stain pink/red. It's a crucial first step in identifying an unknown bacterial isolate
*   **Presumptive Identification:** A preliminary identification of a microorganism based on initial tests, such as colony morphology, Gram stain, and rapid biochemical tests. Presumptive results must be confirmed by more definitive methods
*   **Biosafety Cabinet (BSC):** A ventilated cabinet designed to protect the user, the environment, and the materials being handled from exposure to infectious agents. BSCs are essential for working with BSL-3 pathogens, providing a primary containment barrier
*   **Aerosol Transmission:** The spread of infectious agents through the air in the form of small droplets or particles. Many BSL-3 pathogens are transmitted via aerosol, making it a significant risk in the laboratory
*   **Rapid Test:** A quick diagnostic test used to provide preliminary identification or detection of a microorganism or its products (e.g., antigens, toxins) within a short timeframe (minutes to hours). Examples include catalase test, oxidase test, or rapid antigen tests
*   **Chain of Custody:** A documented process that tracks the movement of a specimen or isolate from collection to disposal, ensuring its integrity and providing a record of who handled it and when. This is essential in cases of suspected bioterrorism or Select Agent investigations to maintain accountability
