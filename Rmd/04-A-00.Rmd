This section the key concepts within Analytic Procedures for Virology, covering specimen sources, major pathogens and disease states, direct detection methods, and mechanisms of action and resistance for antiviral agents

## **Specimen Sources** {-}

*   **Key Concept:** Proper specimen collection is critical for accurate virological testing. The correct specimen type, collection technique, timing, transport, and storage are essential
*   **Specimen Types and Associated Viruses**
    *   **Respiratory Specimens:** Nasopharyngeal swabs/aspirates, nasal swabs, throat swabs, BAL, sputum (Influenza, RSV, SARS-CoV-2, Adenovirus)
    *   **Blood Specimens:** Whole blood, plasma/serum (HIV, Hepatitis viruses, West Nile Virus, Dengue Virus, Zika Virus, EBV, Parvovirus B19)
    *   **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):** (Enteroviruses, HSV, VZV, West Nile Virus)
    *   **Stool Specimens:** (Norovirus, Rotavirus, Adenoviruses, Astrovirus)
    *   **Urine Specimens:** (Cytomegalovirus (CMV), BK Virus, JC Virus)
    *   **Swabs from Vesicles/Lesions:** (Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2), Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV))
    *   **Tissue Biopsies:** (Hepatitis viruses (HBV, HCV), Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSV), CMV, Adenovirus, etc)
    *   **Cervical Specimens:** (Human Papillomavirus (HPV))
*   **Key Considerations:** Laboratory guidelines, proper labeling, relevant clinical information

## **Major Pathogens and Disease States** {-}

*   **Key Concept:** Understanding the etiology, epidemiology, and transmission of major viral pathogens is crucial for laboratory diagnosis and public health management
*   **Categories of Viruses and Associated Diseases**
    *   **Respiratory Viruses:** Influenza virus, RSV, parainfluenza virus, SARS-CoV-2 (Influenza, bronchiolitis, croup, COVID-19)
    *   **Vesicles and Lesions:** HSV, VZV (Oral herpes, genital herpes, chickenpox, shingles)
    *   **Cervical Cancer Screening:** HPV (Genital warts, cervical dysplasia, cervical cancer)
    *   **Meningitis:** Enteroviruses, HSV (Viral meningitis, encephalitis)
    *   **Gastroenteritis:** Norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus (Viral gastroenteritis)
    *   **Immunocompromised Host:** CMV, HSV, EBV, BKV, JCV (Pneumonitis, retinitis, PTLD, BKVAN, PML)
    *   **Hepatitis:** HAV, HBV, HCV (Acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer)
    *   **HIV:** HIV (Acute HIV infection, clinical latency, AIDS)
    *   **Other Viruses:** HTLV, West Nile, Zika, MERS, dengue, Ebola (ATL/HAM-TSP, West Nile fever/neuroinvasive disease, Zika fever/congenital Zika syndrome, MERS, dengue fever/severe dengue, Ebola)

## **Direct Detection of Pathogens** {-}

*   **Key Concept:** Direct detection methods identify the virus by detecting viral components (particles, antigens, or nucleic acids)
*   **Methods**
    *   **Microscopy:** Electron microscopy, light microscopy (Visualization of viral particles or inclusions)
    *   **Antigen Detection Assays:** EIA/ELISA, IFA, rapid antigen tests (Detection of viral antigens)
    *   **Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs):** PCR, RT-PCR, real-time PCR, TMA, LAMP (Amplification and detection of viral DNA or RNA)
    *   **Viral Culture:** Growing viruses in cell culture (Isolation and identification of viruses)
    *   **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):** High-throughput sequencing (Identification of novel viruses, characterization of viral genomes)

## **Mechanisms of Action and Resistance for Antiviral Agents** {-}

*   **Key Concept:** Antiviral agents target specific steps in the viral life cycle. Understanding mechanisms of action and resistance is crucial for effective treatment
*   **Mechanisms of Action**
    *   Inhibition of viral attachment and entry
    *   Inhibition of viral nucleic acid synthesis
    *   Inhibition of viral protein synthesis and processing
    *   Inhibition of viral assembly and release
    *   Inhibition of viral integrase
*   **Mechanisms of Resistance**
    *   Mutations in the viral genome
    *   Increased viral replication
    *   Altered viral entry
    *   Increased efflux of the drug
    *   Compensatory mutations
*   **Strategies to Prevent and Manage Resistance**
    *   Combination therapy
    *   Adherence to therapy
    *   Drug resistance testing
    *   Development of new drugs
    *   Public health measures
