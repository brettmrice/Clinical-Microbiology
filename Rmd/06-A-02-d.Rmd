# Mucorales {-}

These fungi are often rapidly growing and can cause serious, life-threatening infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. Because of their aggressive nature, timely diagnosis and treatment are essential. We'll cover the key genera – *Mucor* and *Rhizopus* – along with their disease states, transmission, and lab identification methods

## **Mucorales (Zygomycetes)** {-}

*   **Definition:** Mucorales are a group of filamentous fungi belonging to the subphylum Mucoromycotina (formerly Zygomycetes)
*   **Rapid Growth:** They are characterized by rapid growth and the ability to cause invasive infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals
*   **Hyphae:** They have broad, ribbon-like hyphae that are typically non-septate or sparsely septate (meaning they have few or no cross-walls)
*   **Rhizoids:** Some genera (e.g., *Rhizopus*) produce rhizoids, which are root-like structures that anchor the fungus to the substrate
*   **Sporangia:** They reproduce asexually by forming sporangia, which are sac-like structures containing spores
*   **Disease:** Infections caused by Mucorales are collectively known as mucormycosis (formerly zygomycosis)
*   **Key Genera:** The most common genera causing human infections are *Rhizopus*, *Mucor*, *Lichtheimia* (formerly *Absidia*), *Cunninghamella*, and *Apophysomyces*

## ***Rhizopus spp.*** {-}

*   **Etiology:** *Rhizopus* is the most common genus of Mucorales causing human infections
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Found worldwide in soil, decaying organic matter, and food
    *   Infections are acquired through inhalation of spores, ingestion of contaminated food, or direct inoculation into the skin
    *   Risk factors:
        *   Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (especially diabetic ketoacidosis)
        *   Immunosuppression (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, solid organ transplantation, chemotherapy)
        *   Trauma
        *   Burns
        *   Neutropenia
        *   Deferoxamine therapy (an iron-chelating agent)
*   **Transmission**
    *   Inhalation of spores from the environment
    *   Ingestion of contaminated food
    *   Direct inoculation into the skin or mucous membranes
*   **Disease States**
    *   **Rhino-Orbito-Cerebral Mucormycosis (ROCM):** The most common form of mucormycosis, involving the sinuses, orbit (eye socket), and brain. Symptoms include facial pain, headache, fever, nasal congestion, vision changes, and mental status changes
    *   **Pulmonary Mucormycosis:** Infection of the lungs. Symptoms include cough, fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath
    *   **Cutaneous Mucormycosis:** Infection of the skin, often at the site of trauma or burns. Presents as necrotic ulcers or cellulitis
    *   **Gastrointestinal Mucormycosis:** Infection of the gastrointestinal tract, typically in premature infants or malnourished individuals
    *   **Disseminated Mucormycosis:** Spread of the infection to multiple organs, including the brain, heart, and kidneys
*   **Laboratory Diagnosis**
    *   **Specimen Collection**
        *   Tissue Biopsy: From the affected site (e.g., sinuses, lungs, skin)
        *   Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): For suspected pulmonary infection
        *   Sputum: Less reliable than tissue biopsy or BAL
        *   Blood Cultures: Rarely positive
    *   **Direct Microscopic Examination**
        *   KOH Preparation or Gram Stain: Of tissue samples to visualize broad, ribbon-like hyphae that are typically non-septate or sparsely septate
        *   GMS (Gomori Methenamine Silver) or PAS (Periodic Acid-Schiff) Stain: Of tissue biopsies to highlight fungal elements
    *   **Culture**
        *   Inoculation onto Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) or other fungal media
        *   Rapid growth at 25-30°C, forming cottony, white to gray colonies that fill the Petri dish within a few days
    *   **Identification**
        *   Colony Morphology: Rapid growth and cottony texture
        *   Microscopic Examination: Identification of characteristic sporangia and rhizoids
        *   *Rhizopus* species have rhizoids that originate at the point where the stolon (horizontal hypha) connects to the sporangiophore (the stalk that bears the sporangium)
        *   Molecular Methods: PCR and sequencing for definitive identification

## ***Mucor spp.*** {-}

*   **Etiology:** *Mucor* is another genus of Mucorales that can cause mucormycosis, although less frequently than *Rhizopus*
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Found worldwide in soil, decaying organic matter, and air
    *   Infections are acquired through inhalation of spores or direct inoculation into the skin
    *   Risk factors are similar to those for *Rhizopus* infections
*   **Transmission**
    *   Inhalation of spores from the environment
    *   Direct inoculation into the skin or mucous membranes
*   **Disease States**
    *   Similar to *Rhizopus*, including rhino-orbito-cerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, and disseminated mucormycosis
*   **Laboratory Diagnosis**
    *   **Specimen Collection:** Similar to *Rhizopus*
    *   **Direct Microscopic Examination:** Similar to *Rhizopus*
    *   **Culture:** Similar to *Rhizopus*, with rapid growth and cottony colonies
    *   **Identification**

## **Treatment and Prognosis** {-}

*   **Aggressive Treatment:** Mucormycosis is a rapidly progressive and often fatal infection, requiring aggressive treatment
*   **Surgical Debridement:** Surgical removal of infected tissue is essential
