# Organism Pathogenicity {-}

Understanding the pathogenicity of lower respiratory tract pathogens is crucial for effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of respiratory infections. Pathogenicity is defined as the ability of a microorganism to cause disease, and it is determined by the pathogen's capacity to:

1.  **Colonize:** the host
2.  **Invade:** tissues
3.  **Evade:** the host's immune defenses
4.  **Produce:** toxins or other harmful substances

This is especially important when the source of an infection is in the lower respiratory tract
