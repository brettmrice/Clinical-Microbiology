# Sample Sources {-}

Body fluids from normally sterile sites, such as the pleural, peritoneal, pericardial, vitreous and aqueous humor, synovial, and amniotic fluids, are considered sterile under normal circumstances. The presence of microorganisms in these fluids indicates infection, which requires rapid and accurate diagnosis for effective patient management. Obtaining, handling, and processing these samples with the appropriate protocols is essential for the laboratory's role

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Sterile Environments:** These body fluids are typically sterile, meaning they should not contain any microorganisms in a healthy individual
*   **Infection Indication:** The presence of microorganisms in these fluids is indicative of infection and usually warrants aggressive therapy
*   **Specimen Collection**
    *   **Aseptic Technique:** Strict aseptic technique is absolutely critical during collection to avoid contamination
    *   **Physician Procedure:** Typically performed by a physician (e.g., pulmonologist, gastroenterologist, cardiologist, ophthalmologist, obstetrician, orthopedic surgeon)
    *   **Invasive Procedures:** Collection often involves invasive procedures, such as:
        *   **Thoracentesis:** Pleural fluid
        *   **Paracentesis:** Peritoneal fluid
        *   **Pericardiocentesis:** Pericardial fluid
        *   **Vitreous/Aqueous Tap:** Vitreous/Aqueous fluid
        *   **Arthrocentesis:** Synovial fluid
        *   **Amniocentesis:** Amniotic fluid
*   **Laboratory Procedures**
    *   Rapid and accurate testing to identify or rule out infection is paramount
    *   Initial tests are performed (e.g., Gram stains) to provide preliminary information
    *   Cultures are performed to identify the infecting organism
    *   Other tests (e.g., cell counts, chemistry) are done to provide additional information
