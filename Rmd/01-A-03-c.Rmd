# Time & Temperature {-}

Time and temperature are critical factors in maintaining the viability and integrity of microorganisms during transport from the point of collection to the laboratory. Different organisms have different requirements, and adhering to recommended time and temperature guidelines is crucial for accurate and reliable laboratory results

## **Importance** {-}

*   **Maintaining Viability:** Proper time and temperature conditions prevent the death of microorganisms during transport
*   **Preventing Overgrowth:** Controlling time and temperature can prevent the overgrowth of certain organisms, ensuring that the pathogens of interest can be detected
*   **Preserving Specimen Integrity:** Appropriate time and temperature conditions help maintain the integrity of the specimen, preventing degradation or alteration of the microorganisms
*   **Ensuring Accurate Results:** Proper time and temperature conditions during transport are essential for obtaining accurate and reliable test results, which are critical for patient care

## **General Guidelines** {-}

*   **Minimize Transport Time:** Transport specimens to the laboratory as soon as possible after collection
*   **Maintain Appropriate Temperature:** Store and transport specimens at the recommended temperature range
*   **Follow Laboratory Guidelines:** Adhere to the laboratory's specific guidelines for specimen transport time and temperature
*   **Document Deviations:** Document any deviations from recommended time and temperature guidelines

## **Temperature Ranges** {-}

*   **Refrigerated (2-8°C):** Used for many bacterial, viral, and fungal specimens to slow down metabolic activity and prevent overgrowth
*   **Room Temperature (20-25°C):** Suitable for some bacterial specimens and for specimens where refrigeration may be detrimental
*   **Frozen (-20°C or -70°C):** Used for long-term storage of certain viral and molecular specimens
*   **Body Temperature (35-37°C):** Required for some fastidious organisms and for blood cultures
