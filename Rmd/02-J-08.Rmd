# Sequencing {-}

This section focuses on sequencing, specifically 16S rRNA gene sequencing, as a powerful method for bacterial identification. It covers the theory, interpretation, and application of this widely used molecular technique

## **Theory: Unlocking Bacterial Identity Through the Ribosome's Code** {-}

*   **What is 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing?**
    *   16S rRNA gene sequencing is a *molecular technique* used for bacterial identification and phylogenetic analysis
    *   It involves sequencing a highly *conserved* (present in all bacteria) and *highly variable* (different between species) region of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene
    *   The *unique sequence* of the 16S rRNA gene is used to identify the bacterium to the *species level*
*   **Why Use 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing?**
    *   **Universal:** Present in *all bacteria*, allowing for identification of a broad range of organisms
    *   **Highly Informative:** The 16S rRNA gene contains *conserved regions* for primer design and *variable regions* for species-level differentiation
    *   **Culture-Independent:** Can identify bacteria *without the need for prior culture* (e.g., in complex environments)
    *   **High Accuracy:** Provides *accurate and reliable* species identification
    *   **Phylogenetic Analysis:** Allows for the *determination of evolutionary relationships* between bacteria
    *   **Identification of Non-Culturable Bacteria:** Useful for identifying bacteria that are difficult or impossible to culture
*   **The 16S rRNA Gene**
    *   The 16S rRNA gene is a *highly conserved gene* found in all bacteria
    *   It encodes for the *16S ribosomal RNA*, a structural component of the bacterial ribosome
    *   The gene contains *conserved regions* (highly similar across bacterial species) and *variable regions* (different between species)
    *   The *conserved regions* are used for designing *universal primers* for PCR amplification
    *   The *variable regions* are used for *species-level identification*
*   **General Principle of 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing**
    1.  **DNA Extraction:** Extract DNA from the bacterial sample
    2.  **PCR Amplification:** Amplify the 16S rRNA gene using universal primers that bind to the conserved regions
    3.  **Sequencing:** Determine the nucleotide sequence of the amplified 16S rRNA gene
    4.  **Sequence Analysis:** Compare the sequence to a database of known 16S rRNA gene sequences
    5.  **Identification:** Identify the bacterium based on the sequence match

## **Interpretation: Decoding the Genetic Fingerprint** {-}

*   **Sequencing Results**
    *   **Sequence Data:** The result of the sequencing reaction is a *DNA sequence* representing the 16S rRNA gene
    *   **Sequence Alignment:** The sequence is *aligned* with a database of known 16S rRNA gene sequences
    *   **Percentage Identity:** The *percentage identity* between the unknown sequence and the closest match in the database is calculated. This is the most important result
    *   **Closest Match:** The database provides the *closest matching species* based on the sequence alignment
    *   **E-value:** The *E-value* is a statistical value that estimates the number of hits one can expect to see by chance when searching a database of a particular size. A lower E-value indicates a more significant match
    *   **Confidence Level:** The identification is often reported with a *confidence level* (e.g., high, medium, low)
    *   **Phylogenetic Tree:** The results can be used to construct a *phylogenetic tree* showing the evolutionary relationships between the unknown bacterium and other bacteria
*   **Interpreting the Percentage Identity**
    *   **Species-Level Identification:** Generally, a *percentage identity of >98-99%* is considered sufficient for *species-level identification*
    *   **Genus-Level Identification:** A *percentage identity of 95-98%* may indicate *genus-level identification*
    *   **Unidentified:** If the percentage identity is *low* (e.g., <95%), the bacterium may be a *novel species* or may not be present in the database
*   **Factors Affecting Accuracy**
    *   **Database Quality:** The *accuracy and completeness* of the database are critical
    *   **Sequence Quality:** The *quality of the sequencing data* affects the accuracy of the identification
    *   **Primer Specificity:** The *primers used for PCR amplification* must be specific to the 16S rRNA gene
    *   **Multiple Organisms:** If the sample contains *multiple organisms*, the results may be ambiguous
    *   **Strain Variation:** *Strain variation* can affect the sequence, but the method is usually robust enough to identify down to the species level

## **Application: Putting Knowledge into Practice** {-}

*   **Quality Control (QC)**
    *   **Control Strains:** Use known positive and negative control organisms for each run
    *   **Sequencing of the Control Strains:** Sequence known species to check if the sequencing process and database are working correctly
    *   **Sequence Quality Checks:** Assess the *quality of the sequencing data* (e.g., read length, Phred scores)
    *   **Documentation:** Record QC results in a logbook or LIS
    *   **Repeat if Necessary:** If QC fails, repeat the sequencing run
*   **Procedure**
    1.  **Sample Preparation:** Prepare the bacterial sample (e.g., from a pure culture, from a clinical sample)
    2.  **DNA Extraction:** Extract DNA from the sample using a suitable extraction method
    3.  **PCR Amplification:** Amplify the 16S rRNA gene using universal primers
    4.  **PCR Product Purification:** Purify the PCR product to remove excess primers and other contaminants
    5.  **Sequencing**
        *   Prepare the sequencing reaction
        *   Load the sample into the sequencing instrument
        *   Run the sequencing reaction
    6.  **Sequence Analysis**
        *   Obtain the sequence data
        *   Trim the sequence to remove low-quality regions
        *   Align the sequence with a database
        *   Determine the percentage identity and closest match
        *   Generate a phylogenetic tree (optional)
    7.  **Result Interpretation:** Interpret the results based on the percentage identity and the closest match
    8.  **Documentation:** Record the results in the LIS
    9.  **Correlation:** Correlate the results with Gram stain, colony morphology, and other clinical information
    10. **Reporting:** Report the identification to the clinician
