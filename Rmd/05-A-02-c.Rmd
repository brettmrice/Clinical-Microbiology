# Intestinal & Tissue Helminths {-}

This section tackles the fascinating (and sometimes unsettling) world of helminths â€“ parasitic worms that can make their homes in our intestines and tissues. We'll cover some major players: *Ascaris, Enterobius, hookworm, Schistosoma, Strongyloides, Taenia, Diphyllobothrium, Trichinella,* and *Trichuris*, focusing on their etiology, epidemiology, and transmission

##  ***Ascaris lumbricoides* (Ascariasis)** {-}

*   **Etiology:** *Ascaris lumbricoides* is a large roundworm that infects the small intestine
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Global Distribution:** Worldwide, but more common in tropical and subtropical regions with poor sanitation
    *   **Risk Factors**
        *   Poor sanitation and hygiene practices
        *   Use of human feces as fertilizer
        *   Eating unwashed or undercooked vegetables grown in contaminated soil
        *   Contact with contaminated soil
    *   **High Worm Burden:** Heavy infections can cause malnutrition and intestinal obstruction
*   **Transmission**
    *   **Fecal-Oral Route:** Transmission occurs through ingestion of embryonated eggs (containing larvae) in contaminated food or water, or from contaminated soil
    *   **Life Cycle**
        *   Eggs are ingested and hatch in the small intestine, releasing larvae
        *   Larvae penetrate the intestinal wall and migrate to the lungs via the bloodstream
        *   In the lungs, larvae mature and migrate up the trachea, are swallowed, and return to the small intestine
        *   In the small intestine, the worms mature into adults and reproduce
