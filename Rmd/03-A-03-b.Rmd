# Common Contaminant {-}

This section covers the characteristics that help identify a common contaminant, *Mycobacterium gordonae*, and differentiate it from true pathogens

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Ubiquitous in the Environment:** *M. gordonae* is widely distributed in the environment, particularly in water sources (tap water, distilled water, etc.). This makes it a common contaminant in clinical specimens
*   **Low Pathogenicity:** *M. gordonae* is generally considered to be of low pathogenicity, meaning it rarely causes disease in humans. Most isolates represent colonization or contamination rather than true infection
*   **Clinical Significance:** Distinguishing *M. gordonae* from pathogenic mycobacteria is crucial to avoid unnecessary treatment and anxiety for patients

## ***Mycobacterium gordonae*** {-}

*   **Common Name:** "Tap water bacillus"
*   **Clinical Significance:** Typically a contaminant; rarely causes disease
*   **Diseases:** Very rarely, *M. gordonae* has been implicated in pulmonary infections, skin infections, and disseminated infections, primarily in immunocompromised individuals

### **Acid-Fast Reaction** {-}

*   **Acid-Fast:** Strongly acid-fast. Stains readily with carbolfuchsin and resists decolorization with acid-alcohol

### **Colony Morphology** {-}

*   **Egg-Based Media (e.g., Löwenstein-Jensen)**
    *   Smooth, round, dome-shaped colonies
    *   Typically produce a deep yellow to orange pigment, even in the dark (scotochromogenic)
    *   The intensity of the pigment can vary between strains
*   **Agar-Based Media (e.g., Middlebrook 7H10/7H11)**
    *   Similar to egg-based media, but the colonies may appear slightly more transparent

### **Growth Characteristics** {-}

*   **Growth Rate**
    *   Relatively rapid-growing compared to *M. tuberculosis*. Colonies typically appear within 3-7 days on suitable media
*   **Temperature**
    *   Grows well at 25-37°C
*   **Other Characteristics**
    *   **Catalase:** Positive
    *   **Tween 80 Hydrolysis:** Positive
    *   **Urease:** Variable

## **Differentiation from Pathogenic Mycobacteria** {-}

*   **Clinical Context:** The most important factor is the clinical context. *M. gordonae* is unlikely to be a true pathogen unless there is strong evidence of infection (e.g., consistent isolation from multiple specimens, histopathological evidence of tissue invasion)
*   **Scotochromogenicity:** The deep yellow to orange pigment produced in the dark is a key characteristic. While some other mycobacteria can produce pigment, *M. gordonae*'s pigment is typically more intense and consistent
*   **Biochemical Tests**
    *   **Tween 80 Hydrolysis:** This test differentiates *M. gordonae* from other scotochromogenic mycobacteria
*   **Molecular Methods**
    *   **PCR and Sequencing:** These methods provide definitive identification and can differentiate *M. gordonae* from closely related species
*   **Lipid analysis (HPLC):** useful in identifying different mycobacteria

## **When to Suspect Contamination** {-}

*   **Single Positive Culture:** A single positive culture of *M. gordonae*, especially from a non-sterile site (e.g., sputum), is highly suggestive of contamination
*   **Lack of Clinical Correlation:** If the patient has no signs or symptoms of mycobacterial infection, contamination is more likely
*   **Isolation from Water Sources:** If the same strain of *M. gordonae* is isolated from laboratory water sources, contamination is highly probable

## **Laboratory Practices to Minimize Contamination** {-}

*   **Sterile Water:** Use only sterile, distilled water for media preparation and other laboratory procedures
*   **Regular Water Testing:** Routinely test laboratory water sources for mycobacteria
*   **Proper Specimen Collection:** Emphasize proper specimen collection techniques to minimize environmental contamination
*   **Quality Control:** Implement strict quality control procedures to monitor for contamination in media and reagents

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Contaminant:** A microorganism that is unintentionally introduced into a specimen or culture
*   **Scotochromogen:** A microorganism that produces pigment in the dark
*   **Pathogenicity:** The ability of a microorganism to cause disease
*   **Colonization:** The presence of a microorganism on or in a host without causing disease
*   **Tween 80 Hydrolysis:** A biochemical test used to determine the ability of an organism to hydrolyze Tween 80, a nonionic surfactant
*   **Catalase Test:** A biochemical test used to detect the presence of the enzyme catalase, which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen
*   **Urease Test:** A biochemical test used to determine the ability of an organism to produce the enzyme urease, which hydrolyzes urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide
*   **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** A molecular biology technique used to amplify specific DNA sequences
*   **Sequencing:** A molecular biology technique used to determine the nucleotide sequence of DNA
*   **HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography):** An analytical chemistry technique used to separate, identify, and quantify the components in a mixture
