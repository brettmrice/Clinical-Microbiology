# HIV {-}

This section will cover Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), including its etiology, epidemiology, transmission, disease states, and key aspects of its pathogenesis and diagnosis

## **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)** {-}

*   **Etiology**
    *   **Classification:** A member of the *Retroviridae* family, genus *Lentivirus*
    *   **Types**
        *   **HIV-1:** The most common type worldwide. Further classified into subtypes (or clades), with subtype B being predominant in North America and Europe
        *   **HIV-2:** Primarily found in West Africa. Generally less pathogenic and progresses more slowly than HIV-1
    *   **RNA Virus:** HIV is a single-stranded RNA virus that uses reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA into DNA, which is then integrated into the host cell's genome

*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Global Distribution:** Found worldwide, but prevalence varies by region
    *   **Prevalence:** Approximately 38 million people worldwide are living with HIV
    *   **Incidence:** New HIV infections continue to occur, but rates have declined in many regions due to prevention efforts
    *   **Age Groups:** Can affect all age groups, but most new infections occur in adults
    *   **Risk Groups:** Certain populations are at higher risk for HIV infection, including men who have sex with men (MSM), injection drug users, sex workers, and transgender individuals
    *   **Geographic Distribution:** Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest burden of HIV infection

*   **Transmission**
    *   **Sexual Contact:** The most common route of transmission, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex
    *   **Bloodborne:** Sharing needles or syringes, blood transfusions (rare in developed countries due to screening), and occupational exposure in healthcare settings
    *   **Mother to Child (Vertical Transmission):** Can occur during pregnancy, childbirth, or breastfeeding
    *   **Other Body Fluids:** HIV can be found in other body fluids, such as semen, vaginal fluids, breast milk, and blood, but transmission is less common

*   **Disease States**
    *   **Acute HIV Infection:** Occurs within 2-4 weeks of exposure. Characterized by flu-like symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, sore throat, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. High viral load and highly infectious during this stage
    *   **Clinical Latency (Chronic HIV Infection):** The virus is active but reproduces at low levels. Individuals may be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Can last for many years
    *   **Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS):** The most advanced stage of HIV infection. Characterized by a severely weakened immune system, leading to opportunistic infections, cancers, and other complications
    *   **Opportunistic Infections:** Infections caused by pathogens that typically do not cause disease in individuals with healthy immune systems. Common examples include Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), Kaposi's sarcoma, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and tuberculosis (TB)

*   **Pathogenesis**
    *   **Target Cells:** HIV primarily infects CD4+ T cells, which are essential for immune function
    *   **Viral Replication:** HIV enters CD4+ T cells, uses reverse transcriptase to convert its RNA into DNA, and integrates the DNA into the host cell's genome. The virus then replicates, producing new viral particles that infect other CD4+ T cells
    *   **Immune Destruction:** Over time, HIV infection leads to a decline in CD4+ T cell count, weakening the immune system and increasing susceptibility to opportunistic infections and cancers
    *   **Viral Reservoirs:** HIV can establish latent reservoirs in various cells and tissues, making it difficult to eradicate the virus completely

*   **Diagnosis**
    *   **Screening Tests:** Initial tests used to detect HIV infection
        *   **Antibody Tests:** Detect antibodies to HIV in blood or oral fluid. May have a window period (time between infection and antibody detection)
        *   **Antigen/Antibody Combination Tests:** Detect both HIV antibodies and p24 antigen (a viral protein). Shorter window period than antibody tests
    *   **Confirmatory Tests:** Used to confirm a positive screening test
        *   **HIV-1/HIV-2 Antibody Differentiation Assay:** Distinguishes between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies
        *   **HIV-1 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAT):** Detects HIV-1 RNA in plasma. Used to confirm HIV-1 infection and measure viral load
    *   **Viral Load Testing:** Measures the amount of HIV RNA in plasma. Used to monitor treatment response and disease progression
    *   **CD4+ T Cell Count:** Measures the number of CD4+ T cells in blood. Used to assess immune function and guide treatment decisions
    *   **Drug Resistance Testing:** Used to identify mutations in the HIV genome that confer resistance to antiretroviral drugs. Helps guide treatment selection

*   **Treatment**
    *   **Antiretroviral Therapy (ART):** Combination of drugs that suppress HIV replication, reduce viral load, and improve immune function. Does not cure HIV, but can control the virus and prevent disease progression
    *   **Classes of ART Drugs**
        *   **Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (RTIs)**
            *   Nucleoside/Nucleotide RTIs (NRTIs)
            *   Non-Nucleoside RTIs (NNRTIs)
        *   **Protease Inhibitors (PIs)**
        *   **Integrase Inhibitors (INSTIs)**
        *   **Fusion Inhibitors**
        *   **CCR5 Antagonists**
        *   **Post-Attachment Inhibitors**
    *   **Goals of ART**
        *   Achieve and maintain undetectable viral load
        *   Restore and preserve immune function
        *   Prevent opportunistic infections and cancers
        *   Reduce HIV transmission
    *   **Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):** Use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-negative individuals to prevent HIV infection. Highly effective when taken as prescribed
    *   **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Use of antiretroviral drugs after a potential exposure to HIV to prevent infection. Must be started within 72 hours of exposure

*   **Prevention**
    *   **Safe Sex Practices:** Using condoms consistently and correctly
    *   **Testing and Treatment:** Regular HIV testing and prompt treatment for those who are infected
    *   **Needle Exchange Programs:** Providing sterile needles and syringes to injection drug users
    *   **Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission:** Antiretroviral drugs for pregnant women with HIV and their infants
    *   **Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP):** Use of antiretroviral drugs by HIV-negative individuals to prevent HIV infection
    *   **Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP):** Use of antiretroviral drugs after a potential exposure to HIV to prevent infection
