# Colony Morphology & ID {-}

The ability to recognize and identify major bacterial and fungal pathogens from blood and bone marrow cultures is paramount for timely and accurate diagnosis, crucial for guiding antimicrobial therapy and improving patient outcomes

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Culture Media:** Blood and bone marrow cultures are typically inoculated onto a variety of media
    *   **Blood Agar (BAP):** A general-purpose, enriched, non-selective medium that supports the growth of most bacteria
    *   **Chocolate Agar (CHOC):** An enriched medium that supports the growth of fastidious organisms and enhances the recovery of *Haemophilus influenzae* and *Neisseria meningitidis*
    *   **Anaerobic Media:** Used for blood cultures to support the growth of anaerobic organisms
    *   **Selective and Differential Media:** Media used when specific organisms are suspected
*   **Incubation:** Cultures are typically incubated at 35-37Â°C in an incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere
*   **Daily Examination:** Cultures are examined daily for the presence of bacterial or fungal growth. The technologist examines plates for
    *   Colony Morphology (size, shape, color, texture, hemolysis)
    *   Gram Stain Characteristics
*   **Reporting:** All isolates are identified. A Gram stain of the isolate is performed, which provides the initial information for a potential identification
*   **Identification Methods**
    *   **Conventional biochemical tests**
    *   **Commercial identification systems**
    *   **MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry**
    *   **Molecular methods**
*   **Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing:** Performed on all clinically significant isolates to guide antibiotic therapy
