# Morphology & Growth {-}

Colony morphology and growth characteristics are  crucial aspects of mycology, as they often provide the first clues to identifying a particular fungus. We'll cover the key features to observe, how temperature and incubation time affect growth, and then highlight the characteristics of some major pathogens

## **Key Features of Colony Morphology** {-}

When examining a fungal colony, consider the following characteristics:

*   **Growth Rate:** How quickly does the colony grow? (e.g., rapid, moderate, slow)
*   **Texture:** What is the surface texture of the colony? (e.g., cottony, woolly, granular, velvety, glabrous/smooth, waxy)
*   **Elevation:** How does the colony rise above the agar surface? (e.g., flat, raised, heaped, rugose/wrinkled)
*   **Margin:** What is the edge of the colony like? (e.g., smooth, irregular, filamentous, lobate)
*   **Color (Top and Reverse):** What color is the colony on the surface? What color is the underside of the colony (visible through the agar)? Pigment production can be key for identification
*   **Other Features:** Are there any other notable features, such as:
    *   **Exudate:** Production of droplets on the colony surface
    *   **Diffusible Pigment:** Pigment that spreads into the agar
    *   **Zonation:** Concentric rings of different colors or textures

## **Impact of Temperature and Incubation Time** {-}

*   **Temperature**
    *   Most fungi grow optimally at temperatures between 25-30°C, which is why this is the standard incubation temperature for fungal cultures
    *   Some fungi grow better at 35-37°C, which mimics body temperature and can help in identifying the tissue form of dimorphic fungi
    *   Temperature can also affect colony morphology and pigment production
*   **Incubation Time**
    *   Fungi generally grow slower than bacteria, so fungal cultures require longer incubation times
    *   Most fungal cultures are incubated for up to 4 weeks (28 days), with regular observation for growth
    *   Some slow-growing fungi may require even longer incubation times
