# Culture Methods {-}

This section covers culture methods used for MRSA/MSSA, VRE, ESBL/CRE screening. This is where we get to see the bacteria "grow" and give us clues about their identity and resistance

##  **MRSA/MSSA Screening** {-}

*   **Selective Media**
    *   **Chromogenic Media:** These media contain chromogenic substrates that are cleaved by bacterial enzymes, producing distinct colored colonies. For MRSA, the media often contain an antibiotic (e.g., oxacillin or cefoxitin) and a chromogen that turns the *S. aureus* colonies a specific color (e.g., pink, mauve, or blue) if the bacteria are resistant
    *   **Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA):** This is a differential and selective media. It contains a high concentration of salt, which inhibits most bacteria except staphylococci. *S. aureus* ferments mannitol, producing acid and turning the pH indicator (phenol red) yellow
*   **Non-Selective Media**
    *   **Blood Agar Plate (BAP):** All swabs are plated on BAP. This allows for the growth of all bacteria
*   **Incubation:** Incubate at 35-37°C in ambient air (no added CO2) for 24-48 hours
*   **Identification**
    *   **Colony Morphology:** *S. aureus* typically appears as large, round, creamy, or golden colonies on BAP
    *   **Gram Stain:** Gram-positive cocci in clusters
    *   **Coagulase Test:** This is the gold standard for differentiating *S. aureus* from other staphylococci. Coagulase-positive indicates *S. aureus*
    *   **Oxacillin or Cefoxitin Disk Diffusion:** This is a standard method to determine methicillin resistance
    *   **Latex Agglutination:** Latex agglutination tests are available to detect the presence of PBP2a (the protein encoded by the *mecA* gene) or to confirm *S. aureus*

##  **VRE Screening** {-}

*   **Selective Media**
    *   **Bile Esculin Agar (BEA) with Vancomycin:** BEA is used because it selects for enterococci. The addition of vancomycin inhibits vancomycin-susceptible organisms
    *   **Chromogenic Media:** Similar to MRSA, chromogenic media can be used. The media contains vancomycin and a chromogen that helps identify enterococci
*   **Incubation:** Incubate at 35-37°C in ambient air for 24-48 hours
*   **Identification**
    *   **Colony Morphology:** Enterococci typically appear as small, white or gray colonies on BAP or BEA
    *   **Gram Stain:** Gram-positive cocci in pairs or short chains
    *   **Catalase Test:** Negative (enterococci are catalase-negative)
    *   **Vancomycin Susceptibility Testing:** Performed using disk diffusion or automated methods to confirm vancomycin resistance

##  **ESBL/CRE Screening** {-}

*   **Selective Media**
    *   **Chromogenic Media:** These media contain a chromogen and an antibiotic to select for ESBL- or carbapenem-resistant organisms
    *   **MacConkey Agar:** This is a differential media, allowing for the growth of Gram-negative bacteria while inhibiting Gram-positive organisms
*   **Incubation:** Incubate at 35-37°C in ambient air for 24-48 hours
*   **Identification**
    *   **Colony Morphology:** The morphology depends on the specific organism
    *   **Gram Stain:** Gram-negative bacilli
    *   **Identification and Susceptibility Testing**
        *   **Automated Systems:** Automated identification and susceptibility testing systems (e.g., Vitek, Phoenix) are commonly used
        *   **Modified Kirby-Bauer Disk Diffusion:** Used to test for ESBL production
        *   **Carbapenem Susceptibility Testing:** Disk diffusion or MIC determination is performed
        *   **Phenotypic Tests**
            *   **ESBL Detection:** Double-disk synergy test (using a cephalosporin and clavulanic acid), or other phenotypic tests
            *   **Carbapenemase Detection:** Modified Hodge test, Carba NP test, or other phenotypic tests

## **Key Terms with Definitions** {-}

*   **Selective Media:** Culture media designed to inhibit the growth of some organisms while allowing the growth of others, often containing antibiotics or other inhibitory agents
*   **Differential Media:** Culture media that allows the growth of multiple organisms but differentiates them based on their biochemical properties, often by the use of pH indicators or other reagents
*   **Chromogenic Media:** Culture media that contains chromogenic substrates that are cleaved by bacterial enzymes, producing distinct colored colonies
*   **Colony Morphology:** The visible characteristics of bacterial colonies on an agar plate, including size, shape, color, texture, and edge
*   **Gram Stain:** A differential staining method used to classify bacteria based on their cell wall structure, resulting in either Gram-positive (purple) or Gram-negative (pink/red) staining
*   **Catalase Test:** A biochemical test to detect the presence of the enzyme catalase, which converts hydrogen peroxide to water and oxygen. Used to differentiate between staphylococci (catalase-positive) and streptococci (catalase-negative)
*   **Coagulase Test:** A biochemical test used to differentiate *Staphylococcus aureus* (coagulase-positive) from other staphylococci (coagulase-negative)
*   **Disk Diffusion:** A susceptibility testing method where antibiotic-impregnated disks are placed on an agar plate inoculated with the test organism, and the zone of inhibition around the disk indicates susceptibility
*   **Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC):** The lowest concentration of an antimicrobial agent that inhibits the visible growth of a microorganism
*   **Zone of Inhibition:** The clear area around an antibiotic disk on an agar plate, where bacterial growth is inhibited due to the antibiotic's effect
