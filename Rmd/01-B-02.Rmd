# Biosafety Cabinet & PPE {-}

Biosafety cabinets and personal protective equipment (PPE) are our front-line defenses against potentially hazardous microorganisms. Understanding how to use them properly is absolutely crucial for protecting ourselves, our colleagues, and the integrity of our work

## **Biosafety Cabinets (BSCs): Our Clean Air Fortress** {-}

*   **What is a Biosafety Cabinet?**
    *   A BSC is a specialized, ventilated enclosure designed to protect laboratory personnel, the environment, and the samples being manipulated from exposure to infectious aerosols and splashes
    *   It uses a combination of airflow and HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filtration to create a safe working environment

*   **Why are BSCs Important?**
    *   **Personnel Protection:** BSCs minimize the risk of inhaling or being exposed to infectious agents during procedures that generate aerosols (e.g., pipetting, vortexing, plating)
    *   **Product Protection:** BSCs prevent contamination of samples by airborne particles, ensuring the integrity of cultures and tests
    *   **Environmental Protection:** BSCs filter exhaust air to prevent the release of hazardous microorganisms into the laboratory environment

*   **Types of Biosafety Cabinets**
    *   **Class I BSC**
        *   Provides personnel and environmental protection, but *no* product protection
        *   Air is drawn into the cabinet from the room, across the work surface, and exhausted through a HEPA filter
        *   Suitable for procedures involving low to moderate-risk agents
    *   **Class II BSC**
        *   Provides personnel, product, and environmental protection
        *   Air is drawn into the cabinet, passes through a HEPA filter, flows vertically over the work surface (laminar airflow), and is either recirculated or exhausted through another HEPA filter
        *   **Most common type in clinical microbiology labs**
        *   **Subtypes**
            *   **Type A2:** Most common; 70% of air is recirculated, 30% exhausted
            *   **Type B2:** All air is exhausted; requires hard-ducted connection to the building exhaust system
    *   **Class III BSC**
        *   Provides maximum protection for personnel, product, and environment
        *   Gas-tight enclosure with physical separation between the worker and the materials
        *   Operations are performed with long, heavy-duty rubber gloves attached to the cabinet
        *   Used for high-risk agents (e.g., handling cultures of *Bacillus anthracis*, *Yersinia pestis*)

*   **How to Use a Class II BSC Properly**
    1.  **Preparation**
        *   **Check Certification:** Ensure the BSC is certified annually and functioning correctly
        *   **Disinfect:** Wipe down the interior surfaces of the BSC with an appropriate disinfectant (e.g., 70% ethanol) before and after each use
        *   **Arrange Materials:** Place all necessary materials inside the BSC *before* starting work, minimizing the need to reach in and out during the procedure
        *   **Avoid Overcrowding:** Do not overcrowd the BSC; this can disrupt airflow patterns
    2.  **Operation**
        *   **Turn on the BSC:** Allow the blower to run for at least 5-15 minutes *before* starting work to establish proper airflow (follow manufacturer's instructions)
        *   **Work within the "Safe Zone":** Work at least 4 inches (10 cm) inside the front opening of the BSC to maintain proper airflow and containment
        *   **Minimize Disruptions:** Avoid rapid movements, opening/closing doors, or talking excessively near the BSC, as these can disrupt airflow
        *   **Contain Spills:** Clean up any spills immediately with an appropriate disinfectant
        *   **Proper Pipetting Technique:** Use cotton-plugged pipettes and avoid blowing out the last drop
        *   **Sharps Disposal:** Use a sharps container inside the BSC for discarding needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp objects
    3.  **Completion**
        *   **Decontaminate:** Wipe down all materials and surfaces inside the BSC with disinfectant
        *   **Remove Materials:** Remove all materials from the BSC
        *   **Run the Blower:** Allow the blower to run for at least 5-15 minutes after completing work to purge any remaining aerosols (follow manufacturer's instructions)
        *   **Turn off UV Light (if applicable):** If the BSC has a UV light, use it *only* when the BSC is not in use and no one is present in the room. UV light is harmful to skin and eyes

*   **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
    *   **Blocking Airflow Grilles:** Do not block the front or rear air intake grilles, as this will compromise the BSC's performance
    *   **Using the BSC as Storage:** Do not use the BSC as a permanent storage area; this can reduce airflow and increase the risk of contamination
    *   **Working Too Quickly:** Work deliberately and avoid rushing, as this can increase the risk of spills and aerosols
    *   **Disregarding Alarms:** If the BSC has an alarm, investigate the cause immediately and do not use the BSC until the problem is resolved

## **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): Our Physical Barrier** {-}

*   **What is PPE?**
    *   PPE refers to clothing and equipment designed to protect laboratory personnel from contact with infectious agents and hazardous materials
    *   The type of PPE required depends on the specific risks associated with the procedure being performed

*   **Why is PPE Important?**
    *   **Reduces Exposure:** PPE minimizes the risk of direct contact with microorganisms, preventing infection through skin, mucous membranes, or inhalation
    *   **Protects Clothing:** PPE protects personal clothing from contamination
    *   **Provides a Barrier:** PPE acts as a physical barrier between the worker and potential hazards

*   **Types of PPE Commonly Used in Microbiology Labs**
    *   **Gloves**
        *   **Purpose:** Protect hands from direct contact with infectious materials, chemicals, and contaminated surfaces
        *   **Types**
            *   **Nitrile Gloves:** Most common; offer good chemical resistance and are less likely to cause allergic reactions than latex
            *   **Latex Gloves:** Provide good elasticity and dexterity but can cause allergic reactions in some individuals
            *   **Utility Gloves:** Heavy-duty gloves used for cleaning and disinfecting
        *   **Proper Use**
            *   Wear gloves whenever handling specimens, cultures, or contaminated materials
            *   Change gloves between handling different specimens or when gloves are torn or punctured
