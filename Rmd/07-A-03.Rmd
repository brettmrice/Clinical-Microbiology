# Viral Pathogens {-}

Serodiagnosis is pivotal in identifying and understanding viral infections. By detecting antibodies or viral antigens in a patient's serum, we can determine their exposure history, disease stage, and immune status. This section focuses on the serodiagnosis, clinical significance, and epidemiology of several key viral pathogens: hepatitis viruses (A, B, C), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), rubella virus, and measles virus

## **Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)** {-}

*   **Serodiagnosis**
    *   **Anti-HAV IgM:** Indicates *acute* HAV infection. Appears early in the infection and declines within a few months
    *   **Anti-HAV IgG:** Indicates *past* HAV infection or vaccination. Provides long-term immunity
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   HAV causes acute, self-limiting hepatitis. It does *not* cause chronic infection
    *   Symptoms range from mild (fatigue, nausea) to severe (jaundice, liver failure)
    *   Serodiagnosis confirms the diagnosis and helps distinguish it from other causes of hepatitis
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Transmission: Fecal-oral route (contaminated food or water)
    *   Risk factors: Poor sanitation, travel to endemic areas
    *   Prevention: Vaccination (highly effective) and good hygiene practices
    *   Globally distributed, with higher prevalence in areas with poor sanitation

## **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)** {-}

*   **Serodiagnosis**
    *   **HBsAg (Hepatitis B surface antigen):** Indicates *current* HBV infection (acute or chronic). It's the first marker to appear
    *   **Anti-HBs (Antibody to HBsAg):** Indicates *immunity* to HBV (either from vaccination or past infection). It appears after HBsAg clears
    *   **Anti-HBc IgM (Antibody to Hepatitis B core antigen IgM):** Indicates *acute* or recent HBV infection. Appears shortly after HBsAg
    *   **Anti-HBc IgG (Antibody to Hepatitis B core antigen IgG):** Indicates *past or chronic* HBV infection. Persists for life
    *   **HBeAg (Hepatitis B e antigen):** Indicates *high viral replication* and infectivity
    *   **Anti-HBe (Antibody to HBeAg):** Indicates *lower viral replication* and infectivity
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   HBV can cause acute or chronic hepatitis
    *   Chronic HBV infection can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma
    *   Serodiagnosis helps determine the stage of infection, guide treatment decisions, and assess immunity
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Transmission: Parenteral (blood), sexual contact, mother-to-child (vertical transmission)
    *   Risk factors: Injection drug use, unprotected sex, healthcare workers, infants born to infected mothers
    *   Prevention: Vaccination (highly effective), safe injection practices, screening of pregnant women
    *   Globally distributed, with higher prevalence in certain regions (e.g., Southeast Asia, Africa)

## **Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)** {-}

*   **Serodiagnosis**
    *   **Anti-HCV (Antibody to HCV):** Indicates *exposure* to HCV. Does *not* necessarily mean current infection (some people clear the virus spontaneously)
    *   **HCV RNA:** Detects *active* HCV infection. Used to confirm chronic infection and monitor treatment response
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   HCV often causes chronic hepatitis
    *   Chronic HCV infection can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma
    *   Serodiagnosis is used to screen for HCV infection, confirm chronic infection, and monitor treatment response
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Transmission: Primarily parenteral (blood)
    *   Risk factors: Injection drug use, blood transfusions (before 1992), healthcare workers, tattoos
    *   Prevention: Safe injection practices, screening of blood products
    *   Globally distributed, with varying prevalence depending on risk factors

## **Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)** {-}

*   **Serodiagnosis**
    *   **Viral Capsid Antigen (VCA) IgM:** Indicates *acute* EBV infection (infectious mononucleosis). Appears early and declines within a few months
    *   **VCA IgG:** Indicates *past* EBV infection. Persists for life
    *   **Early Antigen (EA) IgG:** Indicates *acute or reactivated* EBV infection. Usually disappears after acute infection, but can persist in some individuals
    *   **EBV Nuclear Antigen (EBNA) IgG:** Indicates *past* EBV infection. Appears later than VCA IgG and persists for life
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   EBV causes infectious mononucleosis ("mono"), characterized by fatigue, fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy
    *   EBV is also associated with certain cancers (e.g., Burkitt lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma)
    *   Serodiagnosis helps diagnose acute infection and determine past exposure
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Transmission: Saliva ("kissing disease")
    *   Most people are infected with EBV during childhood or adolescence
    *   Ubiquitous worldwide

## **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)** {-}

*   **Serodiagnosis**
    *   **HIV Antibody/Antigen Combination Assay:** Detects both HIV antibodies (IgG and IgM) and the HIV p24 antigen. Used for initial screening
    *   **HIV Antibody Differentiation Assay:** Distinguishes between HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. Used to confirm positive screening results
    *   **HIV RNA (Viral Load):** Measures the amount of HIV RNA in the blood. Used to monitor disease progression and treatment response
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   HIV causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), characterized by a weakened immune system and opportunistic infections
    *   Early diagnosis and treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) can prevent disease progression and improve survival
    *   Serodiagnosis is crucial for identifying infected individuals, monitoring disease progression, and guiding treatment
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Transmission: Sexual contact, parenteral (blood), mother-to-child (vertical transmission)
    *   Risk factors: Unprotected sex, injection drug use, healthcare workers, infants born to infected mothers
    *   Prevention: Safe sex practices, safe injection practices, screening of blood products, ART for pregnant women
    *   Globally distributed, with higher prevalence in certain regions (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa)

## **Cytomegalovirus (CMV)** {-}

*   **Serodiagnosis**
    *   **CMV IgM:** Indicates *acute or recent* CMV infection. Can also be present during reactivation
    *   **CMV IgG:** Indicates *past* CMV infection. Persists for life
    *   **CMV DNA (PCR):** Detects *active* CMV infection. Used in immunocompromised patients and newborns
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   CMV infection is often asymptomatic in healthy individuals
    *   CMV can cause serious disease in immunocompromised patients (e.g., transplant recipients, HIV-infected individuals) and newborns (congenital CMV infection)
    *   Serodiagnosis is used to determine past exposure, diagnose acute infection, and monitor disease in at-risk populations
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Transmission: Close contact (saliva, urine, breast milk, sexual contact)
    *   Most people are infected with CMV during childhood or adulthood
    *   Ubiquitous worldwide

## **Rubella Virus** {-}

*   **Serodiagnosis**
    *   **Rubella IgM:** Indicates *acute* rubella infection. Can also be present during congenital rubella syndrome
    *   **Rubella IgG:** Indicates *immunity* to rubella (either from vaccination or past infection). Used to assess immunity in women of childbearing age
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Rubella (German measles) is usually a mild illness, but can cause serious birth defects if a pregnant woman is infected (congenital rubella syndrome)
    *   Serodiagnosis is used to assess immunity in women of childbearing age and diagnose acute infection
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Transmission: Respiratory droplets
    *   Prevention: Vaccination (MMR vaccine - measles, mumps, rubella)
    *   Rubella has been largely eliminated in many countries due to vaccination efforts

## **Measles Virus** {-}

*   **Serodiagnosis**
    *   **Measles IgM:** Indicates *acute* measles infection
    *   **Measles IgG:** Indicates *immunity* to measles (either from vaccination or past infection)
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Measles is a highly contagious viral illness characterized by fever, rash, cough, and conjunctivitis
    *   Complications can include pneumonia, encephalitis, and death
    *   Serodiagnosis is used to diagnose acute infection and assess immunity
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   Transmission: Respiratory droplets
    *   Prevention: Vaccination (MMR vaccine)
    *   Measles is still a significant public health problem in many parts of the world, particularly in areas with low vaccination rates
