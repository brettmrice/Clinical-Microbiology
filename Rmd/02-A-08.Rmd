# Organism Pathogenicity {-}

Understanding the pathogenicity of microorganisms is fundamental to clinical microbiology, enabling effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of infectious diseases. Pathogenicity encompasses the ability of a microorganism to cause disease, which is determined by its ability to:

1.  **Colonize:** a host
2.  **Invade:** tissues
3.  **Evade:** the host's immune defenses
4.  **Produce:** toxins or other harmful substances

This understanding is crucial in the context of blood and bone marrow infections
