# Transport Systems {-}

This section provides an overview of the critical elements involved in specimen transport systems and conditions, focusing on transport devices, atmosphere, and time/temperature considerations. Proper specimen transport is essential for maintaining the viability and integrity of microorganisms, ensuring accurate and reliable laboratory results

##  **Importance of Proper Specimen Transport** {-}

*   **Maintaining Viability:** Preserving the viability of microorganisms during transport is essential for accurate detection and identification
*   **Preventing Overgrowth:** Controlling the transport conditions can prevent the overgrowth of certain organisms, ensuring that the pathogens of interest can be detected
*   **Preserving Specimen Integrity:** Appropriate transport conditions help maintain the integrity of the specimen, preventing degradation or alteration of the microorganisms
*   **Ensuring Accurate Results:** Proper transport conditions are essential for obtaining accurate and reliable test results, which are critical for patient care

##  **Transport Devices** {-}

*   **General Requirements:** Sterility, leak-proof design, appropriate medium, temperature control, and clear labeling
*   **Types of Transport Devices**
    *   **Swabs**
        *   Amies Transport Medium: Widely used for bacterial culture, available with or without charcoal
        *   Liquid Amies Transport Medium: Suitable for automated specimen processing and molecular testing
        *   Dacron or Rayon Swabs: Preferred over cotton swabs
    *   **Sterile Containers**
        *   Sterile Urine Containers: Available with or without preservatives
        *   Sterile Specimen Cups: Used for stool, sputum, and tissue specimens
        *   Anaerobic Transport Containers: Maintain an oxygen-free environment
    *   **Transport Media for Specific Organisms**
        *   Cary-Blair Medium: For transporting stool specimens for bacterial culture
        *   Viral Transport Medium (VTM): For viral culture and molecular testing
        *   Mycobacterial Transport Medium: Middlebrook 7H9 broth, Dubos broth
        *   Fungal Transport Medium: Mycosel agar, Sabouraud dextrose agar
    *   **Blood Culture Bottles**
        *   Aerobic Bottles: For aerobic bacteria
        *   Anaerobic Bottles: For anaerobic bacteria
        *   Pediatric Bottles: For smaller blood volumes
*   **Selection of Appropriate Transport Device:** Consider the type of specimen, suspected organisms, testing requirements, and laboratory guidelines

##  **Atmosphere** {-}

*   **Importance:** Different organisms have different atmospheric requirements for survival and growth
*   **Types of Atmospheric Requirements**
    *   Aerobic: Requires the presence of oxygen
    *   Anaerobic: Requires the absence of oxygen
    *   Facultative Anaerobic: Can grow in the presence or absence of oxygen
    *   Microaerophilic: Requires a reduced level of oxygen (5-10%)
    *   Capnophilic: Requires an elevated level of carbon dioxide (5-10%)
*   **Methods for Controlling Atmosphere During Transport**
    *   Aerobic Transport: Swabs in transport media, sterile containers with tight-fitting lids
    *   Anaerobic Transport: Anaerobic transport vials and bags, minimize exposure to air
    *   Microaerophilic Transport: Specialized transport media, gas-generating packets
    *   Capnophilic Transport: Gas-generating packets, candle extinction jar
*   **Specific Considerations**
    *   Wound Specimens: Anaerobic transport systems
    *   Genital Specimens: Capnophilic environment for *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*
    *   Gastrointestinal Specimens: Microaerophilic environment for *Campylobacter*
    *   Respiratory Specimens: Capnophilic environment for *Streptococcus pneumoniae* or *Haemophilus influenzae*

##  **Time and Temperature** {-}

*   **Importance:** Time and temperature are critical for maintaining the viability and integrity of microorganisms during transport
*   **General Guidelines**
    *   Minimize transport time
    *   Maintain appropriate temperature
    *   Follow laboratory guidelines
    *   Document deviations
*   **Temperature Ranges**
    *   Refrigerated (2-8°C): For many bacterial, viral, and fungal specimens
    *   Room Temperature (20-25°C): For some bacterial specimens and specimens where refrigeration may be detrimental
    *   Frozen (-20°C or -70°C): For long-term storage of certain viral and molecular specimens
    *   Body Temperature (35-37°C): For some fastidious organisms and blood cultures
*   **Specific Recommendations**
    *   Bacterial Specimens: Transport most at refrigerated temperatures (2-8°C) within 24-72 hours; *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* at room temperature or body temperature within 6 hours
    *   Viral Specimens: Transport most at refrigerated temperatures (2-8°C) within 48 hours; for long-term storage, freeze at -70°C
    *   Fungal Specimens: Transport most at room temperature (20-25°C) or refrigerated temperatures (2-8°C) within 24-72 hours
    *   Mycobacterial Specimens: Transport at refrigerated temperatures (2-8°C) within 24 hours
    *   Blood Cultures: Transport at body temperature (35-37°C) or room temperature (20-25°C) as soon as possible; do not refrigerate
    *   Urine Specimens: Transport at refrigerated temperatures (2-8°C) within 24 hours; unpreserved urine within 2 hours

##  **Common Errors and How to Avoid Them** {-}

*   Using expired transport devices
*   Improper storage of transport devices
*   Overfilling or underfilling transport devices
*   Delay in transport
*   Failure to label
*   Improper use of anaerobic transport systems
*   Exposure to air
*   Failure to use appropriate transport media
*   Refrigerating blood cultures
*   Failure to document deviations
