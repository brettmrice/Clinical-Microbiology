# Agents of Endocarditis {-}

Endocarditis, the inflammation of the heart's inner lining (endocardium), including the valves, is a serious and life-threatening infection. Bacteremia is a major risk factor. The rapid and accurate identification of the causative agents is crucial for guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy and improving patient outcomes

## **Common Agents of Endocarditis** {-}

### ***Staphylococcus aureus*** {-}
*   **Prevalence:** The most common cause of endocarditis, particularly in intravenous drug users (IVDUs), patients with prosthetic valves, and healthcare-associated infections
*   **Characteristics:** Often rapidly progressive, with severe valvular damage
*   **Virulence:** Highly virulent, producing toxins and enzymes that contribute to tissue damage and spread
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Fever, chills, new heart murmur, embolic events (e.g., stroke, pulmonary emboli), skin manifestations (e.g., petechiae, Osler's nodes, Janeway lesions)
*   **Treatment:** Requires aggressive antibiotic therapy, often combined with surgical intervention (e.g., valve replacement)

### **Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci (CoNS)** {-}
*   **Prevalence:** Common cause, especially for prosthetic valve endocarditis, but also in native valve infections
*   **Characteristics:** Often associated with indwelling devices (e.g., central venous catheters, pacemakers)
*   **Species:** Most commonly, *Staphylococcus epidermidis*
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Often a more indolent course than *S. aureus*, with fever, new heart murmur, and potentially embolic events
*   **Antibiotic Resistance:** CoNS often exhibit antimicrobial resistance, especially to beta-lactam antibiotics, making treatment challenging

### ***Streptococcus spp.*** {-}
*   **Prevalence:** *Streptococcus* species are a significant cause of endocarditis
*   **Types**
    *   ***Streptococcus viridans* group:** The most common *Streptococcus* species causing endocarditis. These are normal inhabitants of the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract
    *   ***Streptococcus bovis* group:** Associated with colon cancer and other gastrointestinal disorders
    *   **Other Streptococci:** including *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Streptococcus pyogenes*, are less common but can cause endocarditis
*   **Characteristics:** Can cause both acute and subacute endocarditis. May be associated with dental procedures or other invasive procedures
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Fever, new heart murmur, embolic events. Can cause a more gradual onset of symptoms than *S. aureus*
*   **Treatment:** Typically responds well to penicillin-based antibiotics

### ***Enterococcus spp.*** {-}
*   **Prevalence:** Important cause, especially in healthcare-associated endocarditis and IVDU
*   **Characteristics:** Can cause both native and prosthetic valve endocarditis. Often associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs) and gastrointestinal infections
*   **Species:** Primarily *Enterococcus faecalis* and *Enterococcus faecium*
*   **Antibiotic Resistance:** *Enterococcus* species are often resistant to multiple antibiotics, including vancomycin (VRE), posing significant treatment challenges
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Fever, new heart murmur, embolic events. Can cause a more indolent course
*   **Treatment:** Requires combination antibiotic therapy, sometimes including agents like ampicillin, vancomycin, and aminoglycosides

### **Gram-Negative Bacteria** {-}
*   **Prevalence:** Less common than gram-positive organisms, but are important causes of endocarditis
*   **Characteristics:** Often associated with healthcare-associated infections, IVDU, and prosthetic valve infections
*   **Types**
    *   ***HACEK* organisms:** A group of fastidious gram-negative bacteria: *Haemophilus spp.*, *Aggregatibacter spp.* (formerly *Actinobacillus*), *Cardiobacterium hominis*, *Eikenella corrodens*, and *Kingella kingae*
    *   ***Pseudomonas aeruginosa***: A pathogen in IVDU and prosthetic valve endocarditis. Often difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance
    *   ***Enterobacteriaceae* (e.g., *Escherichia coli*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*):** Can cause endocarditis, particularly in patients with indwelling devices or other risk factors
    *   **Clinical Presentation:** Fever, new heart murmur, embolic events. Can cause a more acute or chronic course, depending on the organism
*   **Treatment:** Antibiotic therapy typically includes broad-spectrum agents, with treatment tailored to the specific organism and its susceptibility profile

### **Fungi** {-}
*   **Prevalence:** Uncommon, but cause significant morbidity and mortality
*   **Characteristics:** Often associated with prosthetic valves, IVDU, prolonged antibiotic therapy, and immunocompromised patients
*   **Types**
    *   ***Candida spp.***: The most common fungal cause of endocarditis
    *   ***Aspergillus spp.***: Less common, but can cause aggressive infections
*   **Clinical Presentation:** Fever, new heart murmur, embolic events. Can have a subacute or chronic course. May be difficult to diagnose
*   **Treatment:** Requires antifungal therapy, often with surgical intervention

## **Less Common Agents of Endocarditis** {-}
*   **Nutritionally Variant Streptococci (NVS)**
    *   These are *Streptococci* that require pyridoxal (Vitamin B6) for growth
    *   They are difficult to identify by routine laboratory methods
*   **Brucella spp.:** A zoonotic pathogen; endocarditis is rare but can occur
*   **Coxiella burnetii:** Causes Q fever. Endocarditis can occur years after the initial infection
*   **Tropheryma whipplei:** Causes Whipple's disease, and endocarditis is a rare manifestation
*   **Bartonella spp.:** Endocarditis is associated with *Bartonella*, particularly in patients with valvular heart disease
*   **Chlamydia psittaci:** Causes psittacosis (parrot fever), and endocarditis is a rare complication

## **Additional Considerations** {-}

*   **Culture-Negative Endocarditis**
    *   In approximately 2.5-31% of cases, blood cultures are negative, despite clinical signs of endocarditis
    *   Reasons
        *   Antibiotic use before blood cultures
        *   Fastidious organisms (e.g., *HACEK* organisms, *Brucella*)
        *   Non-bacterial causes (e.g., fungal endocarditis, sterile endocarditis)
        *   Inadequate blood culture technique
    *   **Diagnosis:** Requires echocardiography and/or other imaging techniques, serological testing, and, in some cases, valve biopsy for definitive diagnosis
*   **Prosthetic Valve Endocarditis (PVE)**
    *   A major complication of prosthetic valve replacement
    *   **Early PVE:** Occurs within 60 days of surgery. *Staphylococcus aureus* and CoNS are the most common causes
    *   **Late PVE:** Occurs >12 months after surgery. *Streptococci* and *Enterococci* are more common causes
*   **Infective Endocarditis (IE) vs. Non-Infective Endocarditis**
    *   IE is caused by infection, whereas non-infective endocarditis is usually caused by a sterile vegetation
