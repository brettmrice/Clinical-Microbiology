# Sample Sources {-}

Accurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections is essential for proper patient care, and this requires the proper collection, handling, and processing of respiratory specimens. A thorough understanding of the various specimen sources and their associated procedures is critical for clinical microbiology

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Infection Sites:** The lower respiratory tract (lungs, bronchi, bronchioles) is normally sterile
*   **Specimen Collection:** Obtaining appropriate samples is crucial, and will often require special procedures
*   **Challenges:** The specimens are often contaminated by upper respiratory flora. Also, the methods of specimen collection can be difficult
*   **Purpose of Laboratory Testing:** To isolate and identify the pathogens responsible for the infection
*   **Quality of the Specimen:** The quality of the specimen is important. The laboratory may need to assess the quality of the sample

## **Specific Specimen Sources** {-}

### **Sputum** {-}

*   **Source:** Secretions from the lower respiratory tract that are expectorated (coughed up)
*   **Indications**

    *   Suspected lower respiratory tract infection
    *   Follow-up of patients with respiratory infections
*   **Collection Procedure**
    *   **Patient Education:** Educate the patient on how to collect a good specimen
    *   **Timing:** Collect the specimen in the morning, before the patient eats or drinks
    *   **Method:** Have the patient cough deeply and forcefully to bring up secretions from the lungs

*   **Collection Procedure**
    *   Performed by a physician, using a bronchoscope
    *   The bronchoscope is inserted into the lungs
    *   Sterile saline is infused into a lung segment
    *   The fluid is then aspirated
*   **Specimen Quality**
    *   Directly from the lungs
    *   Good quality
*   **Processing and Testing**
    *   **Gram Stain:** Perform Gram stain
