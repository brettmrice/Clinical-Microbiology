# Sample Sources {-}

Accurate diagnosis of upper respiratory tract (URT) infections is essential for appropriate treatment and for preventing the spread of contagious diseases. The laboratory plays a vital role, and effective specimen collection is essential for the lab

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Infection Sites:** The URT includes the throat, nasopharynx, middle ear (otitis media), and sinuses (sinusitis)
*   **Common Pathogens:** Viruses and bacteria
*   **Specimen Collection:** Methods must be appropriate for the site of infection
*   **Contamination Risk:** URT samples are often contaminated by normal flora. This makes accurate diagnosis a challenge
*   **Purpose of Laboratory Testing:** To identify the causative agents and guide therapy

## **Specific Sources** {-}

### **Throat Swab** {-}

*   **Source:** The posterior pharynx and tonsils
*   **Indications**
    *   Pharyngitis (sore throat)
    *   Suspicion of *Streptococcus pyogenes* (Group A Streptococcus (GAS)) infection, for example
    *   Suspicion of other pharyngitis
*   **Procedure**
    *   **Materials:** Sterile swab, tongue depressor, gloves, lighting
    *   **Method**
        *   Depress the tongue to visualize the tonsils and posterior pharynx
        *   Swab the tonsils and posterior pharynx, avoiding the tongue and oral mucosa
        *   Rotate the swab firmly over the areas
*   **Considerations**
    *   Swab the tonsils and posterior pharynx
    *   Avoid touching the tongue
    *   Ensure the swab is placed in the transport medium
    *   To enhance the diagnosis of GAS pharyngitis, laboratories may perform a rapid antigen test on the swab. The swab can also be used to culture the bacteria

### **Nasopharyngeal Swab (NP Swab)** {-}

*   **Source:** The nasopharynx (the upper part of the pharynx, behind the nasal cavity)
*   **Indications**
    *   Detection of respiratory viruses
    *   Bordetella pertussis (whooping cough)
    *   Other nasopharyngeal infections
*   **Procedure**
    *   **Materials:** Flexible swab (e.g., calcium alginate or Dacron), gloves, lighting
    *   **Method**
        *   Gently insert the swab through the nostril, parallel to the palate
        *   Advance the swab until it reaches the nasopharynx
        *   Rotate the swab gently, and leave in place for a few seconds to absorb secretions
        *   Remove the swab
*   **Considerations**
    *   Gentle insertion to avoid patient discomfort
    *   Swab should be inserted far enough back
    *   Swab should be placed in transport medium

### **Middle Ear Fluid (Tympanocentesis)** {-}

*   **Source:** Fluid from the middle ear
*   **Indications**
    *   Otitis media (middle ear infection)
*   **Procedure**
    *   **Performed by a physician (otolaryngologist)**
    *   **Materials:** Otoscope, sterile needle, local anesthetic (sometimes)
    *   **Method**
        *   Clean the external ear canal
        *   Insert the needle through the tympanic membrane (eardrum)
        *   Aspirate fluid from the middle ear
*   **Considerations**
    *   Performed under sterile conditions
    *   A small amount of fluid is collected
    *   Specimen is immediately transported to the lab

### **Sinus Aspirate** {-}

*   **Source:** Fluid from the sinuses
*   **Indications**
    *   Sinusitis (sinus infection)
*   **Procedure**
    *   **Performed by a physician (otolaryngologist)**
    *   **Materials:** Local anesthetic, sterile needle
    *   **Method**
        *   The sinus is punctured through the cheek or through the nose
        *   Fluid is aspirated
*   **Considerations**
    *   Performed under sterile conditions
    *   Must be transported to the lab immediately

## **Handling and Processing** {-}

*   **Prompt Transport:** Transport specimens to the laboratory as soon as possible after collection
*   **Proper Storage**
    *   Room temperature for most swabs
    *   Refrigeration may be needed
*   **Appropriate Media**
    *   **Throat Swabs:** Blood agar
    *   **NP Swabs:** Viral transport media, Bordetella transport media
    *   **Middle Ear Fluid, Sinus Aspirates:** Blood agar, CHOC
*   **Testing and Procedures**
    *   **Rapid Antigen Tests:** Often done for throat swabs
    *   **Gram Stain:** Examine middle ear fluid and sinus aspirates
    *   **Culture:** Inoculate appropriate media
    *   **PCR:** Molecular methods, used to detect viruses and Bordetella
*   **Proper Labeling:** Labeling must be done properly
