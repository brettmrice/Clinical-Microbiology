# Hepatitis {-}

This section will cover the major viral pathogens causing hepatitis, focusing on Hepatitis A Virus (HAV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). We will discuss their etiology, epidemiology, transmission, disease states, and key differences

## **Viral Hepatitis** {-}

*   **Definition:** Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver, most commonly caused by viral infections. Other causes include alcohol, drugs, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders. Viral hepatitis can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term)

## **Hepatitis A Virus (HAV)** {-}

*   **Etiology**
    *   **Classification:** A member of the *Picornaviridae* family
    *   **Non-Enveloped RNA Virus:** HAV is a single-stranded RNA virus
    *   **One Serotype:** There is only one serotype of HAV
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Global Distribution:** Found worldwide, but more common in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene
    *   **Seasonality:** Can occur year-round, but outbreaks are more common in the fall and winter
    *   **Age Groups:** Can affect all age groups, but children are often asymptomatic
*   **Transmission**
    *   **Fecal-Oral Route:** Primarily spread through the fecal-oral route via contaminated food, water, or surfaces
    *   **Close Contact:** Can also be spread through close personal contact with an infected individual
    *   **Outbreaks:** Common in settings with poor sanitation, such as restaurants, daycare centers, and schools
*   **Disease States**
    *   **Acute Hepatitis:** Characterized by fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), dark urine, and pale stools
    *   **Symptoms:** Typically begin 2-6 weeks after exposure and last for several weeks to months
    *   **Chronic Infection:** HAV does *not* cause chronic infection
    *   **Severity:** Usually self-limiting and resolves without specific treatment
    *   **Complications:** Rarely causes liver failure or death

## **Hepatitis B Virus (HBV)** {-}

*   **Etiology**
    *   **Classification:** A member of the *Hepadnaviridae* family
    *   **DNA Virus:** HBV is a partially double-stranded DNA virus
    *   **Multiple Genotypes:** There are multiple genotypes of HBV (A-J), which vary geographically
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Global Distribution:** Found worldwide, with higher prevalence in certain regions, such as Asia and Africa
    *   **Chronic Infection:** Approximately 257 million people worldwide are living with chronic HBV infection
    *   **Age Groups:** Can affect all age groups, but chronic infection is more common in infants and young children
*   **Transmission**
    *   **Bloodborne:** Spread through contact with infected blood or body fluids
    *   **Sexual Contact:** A common route of transmission
    *   **Mother to Child:** Can be transmitted from mother to child during childbirth (perinatal transmission)
    *   **Injection Drug Use:** Sharing needles or syringes
    *   **Healthcare Settings:** Unsafe injection practices, blood transfusions, and medical procedures
*   **Disease States**
    *   **Acute Hepatitis:** Similar symptoms to HAV, including fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools
    *   **Chronic Hepatitis:** Long-term infection that can lead to cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer)
    *   **Asymptomatic Carriers:** Some individuals with chronic HBV infection are asymptomatic carriers, meaning they do not have symptoms but can still transmit the virus
    *   **Severity:** Chronic HBV infection can range from mild to severe
    *   **Complications:** Cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death

## **Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)** {-}

*   **Etiology**
    *   **Classification:** A member of the *Flaviviridae* family
    *   **RNA Virus:** HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus
    *   **Multiple Genotypes:** There are multiple genotypes of HCV (1-7), which vary in their response to treatment
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Global Distribution:** Found worldwide, with higher prevalence in certain regions
    *   **Chronic Infection:** Approximately 71 million people worldwide are living with chronic HCV infection
    *   **Age Groups:** Can affect all age groups, but chronic infection is more common in adults
*   **Transmission**
    *   **Bloodborne:** Primarily spread through contact with infected blood
    *   **Injection Drug Use:** Sharing needles or syringes is the most common route of transmission in many countries
    *   **Blood Transfusions:** Before routine screening of blood products, blood transfusions were a significant source of transmission
    *   **Healthcare Settings:** Unsafe injection practices and medical procedures
    *   **Sexual Contact:** Less common than HBV, but can occur
    *   **Mother to Child:** Can be transmitted from mother to child during childbirth (perinatal transmission), but less common than HBV
*   **Disease States**
    *   **Acute Hepatitis:** Often asymptomatic or mild symptoms, such as fatigue and jaundice
    *   **Chronic Hepatitis:** Long-term infection that can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma
    *   **Asymptomatic Carriers:** Many individuals with chronic HCV infection are asymptomatic for years or decades
    *   **Extrahepatic Manifestations:** HCV can also cause other health problems, such as fatigue, joint pain, skin problems, and kidney disease
    *   **Severity:** Chronic HCV infection can range from mild to severe
    *   **Complications:** Cirrhosis, liver failure, hepatocellular carcinoma, and death

## **Diagnosis of Viral Hepatitis** {-}
