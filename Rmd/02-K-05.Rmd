#  Intrinsic Resistance Patterns {-}

This section highlights the inherent resistance patterns of common bacterial species. Understanding these intrinsic resistance profiles is crucial for selecting appropriate antibiotics, interpreting susceptibility test results, and avoiding ineffective treatments

## **Intrinsic Resistance** {-}

*   **Definition:** Intrinsic resistance refers to the natural resistance of a bacterial species to a particular antibiotic or class of antibiotics. This resistance is inherent to the organism and is not acquired through mutation or horizontal gene transfer
*   **Mechanisms:** Intrinsic resistance can be due to various factors, including:
    *   **Lack of Target:** The organism may lack the target of the antibiotic
    *   **Impermeability:** The bacterial cell wall or membrane may be impermeable to the antibiotic
    *   **Efflux Pumps:** The organism may possess efflux pumps that actively transport the antibiotic out of the cell
    *   **Enzymatic Inactivation:** The organism may produce enzymes that inactivate the antibiotic
*   **Importance:** Knowing the intrinsic resistance patterns of common species allows for:
    *   **Empiric Therapy:** Selecting appropriate antibiotics for initial treatment before susceptibility test results are available
    *   **Interpreting Susceptibility Results:** Recognizing when an isolate is intrinsically resistant, even if the susceptibility test results suggest otherwise
    *   **Avoiding Ineffective Treatments:** Preventing the use of antibiotics that are known to be ineffective against a particular organism

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Consult Guidelines:** Always refer to current CLSI guidelines or other reputable sources for the most up-to-date information on intrinsic resistance patterns
*   **Consider Site of Infection:** Intrinsic resistance patterns can vary depending on the site of infection. For example, *Enterococcus* species are intrinsically resistant to many cephalosporins, but this is not always relevant in urinary tract infections
*   **Susceptibility Testing is Essential:** While understanding intrinsic resistance is helpful, susceptibility testing is still crucial to confirm the antibiotic susceptibility of each individual isolate
*   **Report Intrinsic Resistance:** Laboratories should report intrinsic resistance patterns to clinicians, especially for common species
