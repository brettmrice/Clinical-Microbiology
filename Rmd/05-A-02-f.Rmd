# Additional Parasites {-}

This section will cover filariae and flukes, two groups of parasitic worms that can cause a range of diseases in humans. We'll explore their etiology, epidemiology, and transmission

##  **Filariae (Filariasis)** {-}

*   **Etiology:** Filariae are parasitic nematodes (roundworms) that infect the lymphatic system, subcutaneous tissues, or serous cavities. Major filarial parasites include:
    *   *Wuchereria bancrofti*
    *   *Brugia malayi*
    *   *Brugia timori* (cause lymphatic filariasis, leading to elephantiasis)
    *   *Onchocerca volvulus* (causes onchocerciasis, or river blindness)
    *   *Loa loa* (causes loiasis, or African eye worm)
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Geographic Distribution:** Tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas
    *   **Risk Factors**
        *   Living in or traveling to endemic areas
        *   Exposure to mosquito or blackfly bites
        *   Poor sanitation and hygiene practices
    *   **Chronic Disease:** Filarial infections can cause chronic and debilitating conditions, such as lymphedema, elephantiasis, and blindness
*   **Transmission**
    *   **Vector-Borne:** Filariae are transmitted by the bites of infected mosquitoes (lymphatic filariasis and loiasis) or blackflies (onchocerciasis)
    *   **Life Cycle**
        *   Adult worms live in the lymphatic system, subcutaneous tissues, or serous cavities
        *   Female worms release microfilariae (larval stage) into the bloodstream or skin
        *   Mosquitoes or blackflies ingest microfilariae during blood meals
        *   Microfilariae develop into infective larvae in the vector
        *   Infective larvae are transmitted to humans during subsequent bites

##  **Flukes (Trematodes)** {-}

*   **Etiology:** Flukes are parasitic flatworms that infect various organs, including the liver, lungs, intestines, and blood vessels. Major flukes include:
    *   **Liver flukes**
        *   *Clonorchis sinensis* (Chinese liver fluke)
        *   *Opisthorchis viverrini* and *Opisthorchis felineus*
        *   *Fasciola hepatica* and *Fasciola gigantica*
    *   **Lung fluke**
        *   *Paragonimus westermani*
    *   **Intestinal flukes**
        *   *Fasciolopsis buski*
    *   **Blood flukes**
        *   *Schistosoma* spp. (as covered previously)
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Geographic Distribution:** Worldwide, with different species prevalent in different regions
    *   **Risk Factors**
        *   Consumption of raw or undercooked freshwater fish, crustaceans, or aquatic plants
        *   Contact with freshwater containing infected snails
        *   Poor sanitation and hygiene practices
        *   Agricultural practices involving irrigation
    *   **Chronic Disease:** Fluke infections can cause chronic inflammation, tissue damage, and cancer
*   **Transmission**
    *   **Ingestion of Larvae:** Liver and intestinal flukes are transmitted through ingestion of raw or undercooked freshwater fish, crustaceans, or aquatic plants containing metacercariae (encysted larval stage)
    *   **Skin Penetration:** Blood flukes (*Schistosoma* spp.) are transmitted through skin penetration by cercariae (free-swimming larval stage) released from snails
    *   **Life Cycle**
        *   Flukes have complex life cycles involving one or more intermediate hosts (typically snails and fish or aquatic plants)
        *   Adult flukes live in the liver, lungs, intestines, or blood vessels
        *   Eggs are released in feces or urine
        *   Eggs hatch in freshwater, releasing miracidia
        *   Miracidia infect snails, where they develop into cercariae
        *   Cercariae are released from snails and either penetrate human skin (blood flukes) or encyst as metacercariae in fish, crustaceans, or aquatic plants (liver and intestinal flukes)
        *   Humans become infected by ingesting metacercariae or through skin penetration by cercariae

##  **Key Takeaways** {-}

*   **Vector-Borne Transmission:** Filariae are transmitted by insect vectors (mosquitoes and blackflies), while some flukes are transmitted through skin penetration by cercariae released from snails
*   **Ingestion of Larvae:** Liver and intestinal flukes are transmitted through ingestion of raw or undercooked freshwater fish, crustaceans, or aquatic plants containing metacercariae
*   **Complex Life Cycles:** Both filariae and flukes have complex life cycles involving multiple hosts and environmental stages
*   **Chronic Disease:** Filarial and fluke infections can cause chronic and debilitating conditions, such as lymphedema, elephantiasis, blindness, and cancer

##  **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Filaria:** A parasitic nematode that infects the lymphatic system, subcutaneous tissues, or serous cavities
*   **Microfilariae:** The larval stage of filarial worms found in the bloodstream or skin
*   **Fluke:** A parasitic flatworm that infects various organs
*   **Trematode:** Another name for fluke
*   **Metacercariae:** The encysted larval stage of flukes found in fish, crustaceans, or aquatic plants
*   **Cercariae:** The free-swimming larval stage of flukes released from snails
*   **Vector-Borne:** Transmitted by an insect or other arthropod vector
*   **Endemic:** A disease that is constantly present in a particular geographic region or population
*   **Lymphatic System:** The network of vessels and tissues that drain fluid from the body and transport it back to the bloodstream
*   **Elephantiasis:** A condition characterized by massive swelling of the limbs and other body parts due to lymphatic obstruction caused by filarial worms
*   **Onchocerciasis:** A parasitic disease caused by *Onchocerca volvulus*, leading to blindness and skin lesions
*   **Loiasis:** A parasitic disease caused by *Loa loa*, characterized by swelling and itching of the skin and migration of the worm across the eye
*   **Lymphedema:** Swelling caused by lymphatic obstruction
*   **Miracidia:** The ciliated larval stage of flukes that infect snails
