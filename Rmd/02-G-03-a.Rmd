#  Skin {-}

This section focuses on the colony morphology and identification of major pathogens associated with skin infections, specifically *Staphylococcus aureus*, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*

## ***Staphylococcus aureus*** {-}

*   **Colony Morphology**
    *   **Agar Plate**
        *   **Blood Agar**
            *   **Size:** Medium to large (2-4 mm in diameter)
            *   **Shape:** Round, circular
            *   **Elevation:** Slightly raised
            *   **Color:** Typically golden-yellow or creamy-white (the "aureus" in the name refers to gold), but can sometimes appear white
            *   **Texture:** Buttery, smooth, and opaque
            *   **Hemolysis:** Beta-hemolytic (complete clearing of the blood agar around the colonies)
        *   **Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA)**
            *   **Appearance:** Colonies appear yellow on MSA because *S. aureus* can ferment mannitol, producing acid and changing the pH indicator (phenol red) in the media
            *   **Background Color:** The agar surrounding the colonies will also turn yellow
    *   **Gram Stain**
        *   Gram-positive cocci
        *   Arranged in clusters, resembling "grape-like" clusters
*   **Identification Methods**
    *   **1. Presumptive Identification**
        *   **Gram Stain:** Gram-positive cocci in clusters
        *   **Catalase Test:** Positive (bubbles are produced when hydrogen peroxide is added)
    *   **2. Definitive Identification**
        *   **Coagulase Test**
            *   **Principle:** Detects the enzyme coagulase, which clots plasma
            *   **Procedure:** Inoculate a small amount of *S. aureus* into rabbit plasma containing EDTA (to prevent clotting). Incubate at 35-37°C
            *   **Interpretation**
                *   **Positive:** Clot formation within a specified time (e.g., 4 hours) indicates *S. aureus*
                *   **Negative:** No clot formation
        *   **Latex Agglutination Test (for Protein A)**
            *   **Principle:** Detects Protein A, a cell wall component specific to *S. aureus*
            *   **Procedure:** A latex reagent coated with IgG antibodies is used to test for Protein A
            *   **Interpretation:** Agglutination (clumping) indicates the presence of *S. aureus*
        *   **Chromogenic Media (e.g., CHROMagar *Staph aureus*)**
            *   **Principle:** Uses chromogenic substrates to differentiate *S. aureus* from other staphylococci
            *   **Appearance:** *S. aureus* colonies appear as a specific color (e.g., mauve or blue)
        *   **Molecular Methods**
            *   **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** Can be used to detect specific genes (e.g., *mecA* gene for methicillin resistance)
            *   **MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry):** Provides a rapid and accurate identification of microorganisms based on their protein profiles

## **Beta-Hemolytic Streptococci** {-}

            *   **Color:** Usually translucent or gray-white
            *   **Texture:** Smooth, sometimes mucoid
            *   **Hemolysis:** Beta-hemolytic (complete clearing of the blood agar around the colonies)
                *   The degree of hemolysis can vary depending on the species (e.g., *Streptococcus pyogenes* typically exhibits a more pronounced beta-hemolysis)
    *   **Gram Stain**

        *   **Beta-hemolysis on Blood Agar**
    *   **2. Definitive Identification**
        *   **Lancefield Grouping (Serological Testing)**
            *   **Principle:** Identifies the specific Lancefield group based on the presence of a specific carbohydrate antigen on the cell wall
            *   **Procedure:** Uses serological reagents (e.g., latex agglutination kits) that react with the specific Lancefield group antigen
            *   **Interpretation:** Agglutination indicates the presence of the corresponding Lancefield group

            *   **Interpretation**
                *   **Positive:** Red color change indicates presumptive identification of Group A *Streptococcus*
                *   **Negative:** No color change
        *   **SXT Susceptibility (for Group B *Streptococcus*)**
            *   **Principle:** Group B *Streptococcus* is typically resistant to SXT (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)
            *   **Procedure:** An SXT disk is placed on a blood agar plate inoculated with the organism
            *   **Interpretation**
                *   **Resistant:** Zone of inhibition (no growth) around the disk indicates presumptive identification of Group B *Streptococcus*
                *   **Susceptible:** No zone of inhibition
        *   **Molecular Methods**
