# Dermatophytes {-}

These fungi are the notorious culprits behind many common skin, hair, and nail infections. Because of their prevalence, understanding their characteristics and how we identify them is crucial. We'll cover the major genera – *Trichophyton* and *Microsporum* – along with their disease states, transmission, and lab identification methods

## **Dermatophytes** {-}

*   **Definition:** Dermatophytes are a group of closely related filamentous fungi that cause superficial infections of the skin, hair, and nails
*   **Keratinophilic:** They have the unique ability to utilize keratin (a protein found in skin, hair, and nails) as a nutrient source
*   **"Tinea" Infections:** Dermatophyte infections are commonly referred to as "tinea" infections, followed by the affected body site (e.g., tinea pedis = athlete's foot)
*   **Genera:** The three main genera of dermatophytes are *Trichophyton*, *Microsporum*, and *Epidermophyton*
*   **Classification:** Dermatophytes are classified based on their natural habitat:
    *   **Geophilic:** Live in the soil (e.g., *Microsporum gypseum*)
    *   **Zoophilic:** Primarily infect animals (e.g., *Microsporum canis*)
    *   **Anthropophilic:** Primarily infect humans (e.g., *Trichophyton rubrum*)
*   **Transmission:** Dermatophytes are transmitted through direct contact with infected individuals or animals, or through contact with contaminated objects (e.g., towels, clothing, floors)
