#  Organism Pathogenicity {-}

Understanding the pathogenicity of gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens is crucial for effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diarrheal illnesses. Pathogenicity is the ability of a microorganism to cause disease, and it is determined by the pathogen's capacity to:

1.  **Colonize:** the host
2.  **Invade:** tissues
3.  **Evade:** the host's immune defenses
4.  **Produce:** toxins or other harmful substances
