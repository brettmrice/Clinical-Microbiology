# Agents of Encephalitis {-}

Encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, can be caused by a variety of infectious agents, including viruses. Arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses) are a significant cause of encephalitis worldwide, transmitted primarily through the bites of infected mosquitoes and ticks. This section will review the serodiagnosis, epidemiology, and vectors of transmission for some key agents of encephalitis, with a focus on West Nile virus and other arboviruses

## **General Principles of Arboviral Encephalitis** {-}

*   **Arboviruses:** A diverse group of viruses transmitted by arthropods (primarily mosquitoes and ticks)
*   **Transmission Cycle:** Typically involves a vertebrate reservoir host (e.g., birds, rodents) and an arthropod vector. Humans are often incidental or dead-end hosts
*   **Clinical Manifestations:** Range from asymptomatic infection to mild febrile illness to severe encephalitis or meningitis
*   **Diagnosis:** Often relies on serological testing to detect antibodies against the virus
*   **Prevention:** Vector control measures (e.g., mosquito spraying, personal protective measures) are key

## **West Nile Virus (WNV)** {-}

*   **Serodiagnosis**
    *   **WNV IgM:** Indicates *recent* WNV infection. Can persist for several months

    *   **Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT):** A more specific test to confirm WNV infection and differentiate it from other flaviviruses
*   **Clinical Significance**
    *   Most WNV infections are asymptomatic

3.  **Serological Testing:** Serum should be tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against relevant arboviruses
4.  **Confirmatory Testing:** Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test (PRNT) may be needed to confirm specific diagnosis and differentiate between cross-reacting antibodies
5.  **Geographic and Exposure History:** Consider the patient's travel history, outdoor activities, and potential exposure to mosquitoes or ticks
