# Antigens & Molecular {-}

Antigen detection and molecular methods have become increasingly important tools in the diagnosis of CSF infections, offering rapid and sensitive alternatives or adjuncts to traditional culture-based techniques. These advanced methods are particularly valuable in situations where time is critical, antimicrobial therapy is needed quickly, or culture results are negative or delayed

## **Antigen Detection Tests** {-}

*   **Purpose:** Rapidly detect specific bacterial or fungal antigens directly in CSF
*   **Principle:** Use antibodies that specifically bind to antigens (specific components of the pathogen)
*   **Benefits**
    *   **Rapid Results:** Results available in minutes to hours
    *   **High Specificity:** Antibodies are highly specific, minimizing false-positive results
    *   **Can Detect Organisms Even if Non-Viable:** Can detect antigens even in the presence of prior antibiotic therapy
    *   **Easy to Perform:** Often simpler and less technically demanding than culture
*   **Types of Tests**
    *   **Latex Agglutination:** Latex beads coated with antibodies against specific antigens. If the antigen is present, the beads will agglutinate (clump together)
    *   **Enzyme Immunoassays (EIAs):** Antibodies are conjugated to an enzyme that produces a color change when the antigen is present
    *   **Immunochromatographic Assays (Lateral Flow Assays):** Antibodies migrate along a strip and bind to the antigen, producing a visible line (similar to a pregnancy test)
*   **Targeted Pathogens**
    *   ***Streptococcus pneumoniae***: Pneumococcal capsular antigen
    *   ***Haemophilus influenzae*:** type b: Capsular polysaccharide antigen
    *   ***Neisseria meningitidis***: Capsular antigens (A, B, C, Y, W-135)
    *   *Cryptococcus neoformans*: Cryptococcal capsular antigen (CrAg)
    *   *Group B Streptococcus:* Capsular antigen
    *   *Other pathogens:* Tests are available for *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Listeria monocytogenes*
*   **Limitations**
    *   **Sensitivity:** Lower sensitivity than molecular methods
    *   **Limited Number of Targets:** Available for only a limited number of pathogens
    *   **Specificity:** Can sometimes have false-positive results
    *   **May Not Provide Antibiotic Susceptibility:** Only detects the antigen; not the viability of the organism
*   **Procedure**
    *   **Specimen Preparation:** CSF is prepared, usually by centrifugation to remove cells and debris
    *   **Test Procedure:** The test is performed according to the manufacturer's instructions
    *   **Result Interpretation:** Positive results indicate the presence of the antigen. Negative results do not rule out infection

## **Molecular Methods** {-}

*   **Purpose:** Rapidly detect specific DNA or RNA sequences of pathogens directly in CSF
*   **Principle:** Amplify target DNA or RNA sequences to detect the presence of the organism

        *   **Most Common Method:** Amplifies specific DNA sequences of pathogens
        *   **Procedure**
            *   DNA is extracted from the CSF
            *   Specific primers (short DNA sequences) are designed to bind to a unique region of the pathogen's DNA
            *   PCR amplification: the DNA is amplified (copied) in cycles, creating millions of copies of the target sequence
            *   Detection: The amplified DNA is then detected using various methods (gel electrophoresis, real-time PCR)
    *   **Real-Time PCR (qPCR)**
        *   **Quantitative Results:** Measures the amount of DNA produced in each cycle, allowing for quantification of the pathogen
        *   **Procedure**
            *   Similar to PCR, but uses fluorescent probes or dyes to detect and quantify the amplified DNA in real-time
            *   Can provide the *viral load*
    *   **Reverse Transcription PCR (RT-PCR)**
        *   **Detects RNA:** Used to detect RNA viruses (e.g., enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus)
        *   **Procedure**
            *   RNA is converted to DNA (reverse transcription)
            *   PCR is then performed on the newly synthesized DNA
    *   **Multiplex PCR**
        *   **Multiple Targets Simultaneously:** Detects multiple pathogens in a single reaction (e.g., bacterial meningitis panel)
        *   **Procedure**
            *   Multiple primer sets are used to amplify different DNA or RNA targets in the same reaction
            *   Different detection methods are used to distinguish the amplified products
    *   **Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)**
        *   **Advanced Method:** Used to identify pathogens when conventional methods are non-diagnostic
        *   **Procedure**
            *   Extract nucleic acids from the sample
            *   Sequencing libraries are prepared and sequenced
            *   Sequencing data are analyzed to identify pathogens

    *   **Cannot Always Provide Antibiotic Susceptibility Information:** Molecular tests can identify the presence of genetic markers for resistance
    *   **Primer Design:** Requires knowledge of the pathogen's genome to design primers
    *   **May Detect Non-Viable Organisms:** Can detect DNA from dead organisms, which may not be clinically significant
