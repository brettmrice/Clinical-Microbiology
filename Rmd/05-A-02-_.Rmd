# Major Pathogens {-}

This section will look into major pathogens and disease states in parasitology

##  **Blood and Tissue Protozoa** {-}

*   **Key Players**
    *   *Plasmodium* spp. (Malaria)
    *   *Trypanosoma brucei* (African Trypanosomiasis/Sleeping Sickness)
    *   *Trypanosoma cruzi* (American Trypanosomiasis/Chagas Disease)
*   **Key Features**
    *   **Transmission:** Primarily vector-borne (mosquitoes, tsetse flies, triatomine bugs)
    *   **Disease:** Can cause severe systemic illness, affecting blood, organs, and the nervous system
    *   **Diagnosis:** Blood smears, serology, molecular tests

##  **Intestinal and Urogenital Protozoa** {-}

*   **Key Players**
    *   *Cryptosporidium* spp
    *   *Entamoeba histolytica*
    *   *Giardia lamblia*
    *   *Trichomonas vaginalis*
*   **Key Features**
    *   **Transmission:** Primarily fecal-oral route (except *Trichomonas*, which is sexually transmitted)
    *   **Disease:** Causes gastrointestinal illness (diarrhea, abdominal pain) or urogenital infection
    *   **Diagnosis:** Stool examination, antigen detection, microscopy, PCR

##  **Intestinal and Tissue Helminths** {-}

*   **Key Players**
    *   *Ascaris lumbricoides*
    *   *Enterobius vermicularis*
    *   Hookworms (*Ancylostoma duodenale*, *Necator americanus*)
    *   *Schistosoma* spp
    *   *Strongyloides stercoralis*
    *   *Taenia* spp
    *   *Diphyllobothrium latum*
    *   *Trichinella spiralis*
    *   *Trichuris trichiura*
*   **Key Features**
    *   **Transmission:** Varied routes â€“ fecal-oral, skin penetration, ingestion of larvae in meat or fish
    *   **Disease:** Can cause a wide range of symptoms depending on the worm and location (intestinal distress, anemia, tissue damage)
    *   **Diagnosis:** Stool examination, serology, tissue biopsy

##  **Brain-Invading Parasites** {-}

*   **Key Players**
    *   *Toxoplasma gondii*
    *   *Naegleria fowleri*
    *   *Acanthamoeba* spp
*   **Key Features**
    *   **Transmission:** Ingestion of oocysts/cysts (*Toxoplasma*), nasal exposure to contaminated water (*Naegleria*), entry through skin/lungs/eyes (*Acanthamoeba*)
    *   **Disease:** Can cause severe neurological damage, encephalitis, and potentially fatal outcomes
    *   **Diagnosis:** Imaging, CSF analysis, biopsy, serology

##  **Insects and Arthropods** {-}

*   **Key Players**
    *   Ticks
    *   Mites (Scabies mites, Chigger mites, Dust mites)
    *   Lice (Head lice, Body lice, Pubic lice)
    *   Bed Bugs
*   **Key Features**
    *   **Transmission:** Direct contact, bites, or through contaminated environments
    *   **Disease:** Can cause skin infestations, allergic reactions, and act as vectors for other diseases
    *   **Diagnosis:** Visual examination, skin scrapings

##  **Additional Parasites** {-}

*   **Key Players**
    *   Filariae (*Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, Brugia timori, Onchocerca volvulus, Loa loa*)
    *   Flukes (*Clonorchis sinensis, Opisthorchis, Fasciola, Paragonimus*)
*   **Key Features**
    *   **Transmission:** Vector-borne (mosquitoes, blackflies) or ingestion of contaminated food/water
    *   **Disease:** Can cause chronic and debilitating conditions like lymphedema, blindness, and liver damage
    *   **Diagnosis:** Blood smears, serology, stool examination, imaging

##  **General Themes** {-}

*   **Global Distribution:** Many parasitic diseases are more prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions due to factors like climate, sanitation, and hygiene
*   **Vulnerable Populations:** Immunocompromised individuals, children, and those living in poverty are often at higher risk
*   **Complex Life Cycles:** Many parasites have complex life cycles involving multiple hosts, which makes control and prevention challenging
*   **Importance of Prevention:** Sanitation, hygiene, safe food and water practices, and vector control are critical for preventing parasitic infections
