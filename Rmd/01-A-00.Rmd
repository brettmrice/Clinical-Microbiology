# (PART\*) Preanalytic {-}

# Collection & Transport {-}

This section covers the key steps involved in ensuring that specimens collected for microbiological analysis are handled properly *before* they even reach the bench for testing. These preanalytic steps are vital for generating accurate and reliable lab results, which directly impact patient care

##  **The Big Picture: Why Preanalytics Matter** {-}

*   **Garbage In, Garbage Out (GIGO):** No matter how sophisticated our lab equipment, if the specimen is collected or transported improperly, the results will be unreliable
*   **Patient Safety:** Accurate results are the foundation of correct diagnoses and treatment plans. Errors in specimen handling can lead to misdiagnosis, delayed treatment, and potentially harmful outcomes
*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Repeat collections, unnecessary testing, and prolonged hospital stays all add to healthcare costs. Proper preanalytic procedures help minimize these costs
*   **Legal and Ethical Considerations:** Labs are responsible for providing reliable results. Errors in specimen handling can have legal and ethical repercussions

##  **Patient Identification and Specimen Labeling: The Foundation of Accuracy** {-}

*   **Goal:** To unequivocally link the specimen to the correct patient
*   **Key Principles**
    *   **Active Patient Participation:** Involve the patient in the identification process whenever possible (ask them to state their full name and date of birth)
    *   **Two-Factor Identification:** Use at least *two* unique patient identifiers (full name, date of birth, medical record number)
    *   **Verification:** Compare patient information with the test request form and resolve any discrepancies *before* proceeding
    *   **Labeling at Bedside:** Label the specimen container *immediately* after collection and *in the presence of the patient*
*   **Essential Label Information**
    *   Patient's Full Name
    *   Patient's Unique Identifier (Medical Record Number)
    *   Date and Time of Collection
    *   Collector's Initials
    *   Specimen Source (e.g., wound site, urine - clean catch)
*   **Common Errors & Solutions**
    *   Misidentification: Asking "Are you Mr. Smith?" instead of asking the patient to state their name
    *   Pre-labeling: Labeling tubes before collection
    *   Illegible Handwriting: Use pre-printed labels or write clearly
    *   Incomplete Labeling: Use a checklist to ensure all information is included
    *   Lid Labeling: Place the label on the container, not the lid

##  **Specimen Collection: The Art and Science** {-}

*   **Goal:** To obtain a representative sample of the infected site while minimizing contamination
*   **Key Principles**
    *   **Sterile Technique:** Use sterile equipment and supplies, practice meticulous hand hygiene, and avoid contaminating the specimen
    *   **Appropriate Collection Device:** Select the correct swab, container, or aspiration needle for the specimen type
    *   **Target the Infection:** Collect from the site most likely to be infected (e.g., base of a wound, purulent portion of sputum)
    *   **Minimize Contamination:** Clean the area before collection and avoid touching surrounding surfaces
    *   **Adequate Volume:** Collect a sufficient amount of specimen for testing
*   **Collection from Sites with Normal Flora**
    *   **Challenge:** Differentiating pathogens from normal flora
    *   **Specimen-Specific Considerations**
        *   Stool: Collect stool directly into a clean container
        *   Wound: Aspirate material from deep within the wound (after cleaning)
        *   Sputum: Collect a deep cough specimen (not saliva)
        *   Throat: Swab the posterior pharynx and tonsils (avoid the tongue)
*   **Blood Culture Collection**
    *   **Key Principles:** Sterile technique is paramount
    *   **Procedure Highlights:** Meticulous skin antisepsis, correct blood volume, proper inoculation of bottles

##  **Specimen Transport Systems and Conditions: Getting It to the Lab in Good Shape** {-}

*   **Goal:** To maintain the viability and integrity of microorganisms during transport
*   **Three Key Factors**
    *   **Transport Devices**
        *   Sterile and leak-proof
        *   Contain appropriate transport medium
        *   Clearly labeled
        *   Examples: Amies swabs, Cary-Blair medium for stool, Viral Transport Medium (VTM)
    *   **Atmosphere**
        *   Different organisms have different atmospheric requirements (aerobic, anaerobic, microaerophilic, capnophilic)
        *   Use appropriate transport systems to maintain the correct atmosphere (anaerobic transport vials, gas-generating packets)
    *   **Time and Temperature**
        *   Minimize transport time
        *   Store and transport specimens at the recommended temperature range (refrigerated, room temperature, frozen, body temperature)
        *   Follow lab guidelines
*   **Specific Recommendations**
    *   *Neisseria gonorrhoeae:* Transport at room temperature or body temperature within 6 hours
    *   Viral specimens: Transport refrigerated within 48 hours
    *   Blood cultures: Transport at body temperature or room temperature; do not refrigerate

##  **Key Takeaways** {-}

*   Preanalytic procedures are vital for accurate and reliable microbiology results
*   Patient identification and specimen labeling are the foundation of accuracy
*   Specimen collection requires careful technique to obtain a representative sample while minimizing contamination
*   Proper transport systems and conditions are essential for maintaining the viability and integrity of microorganisms
*   Continuous training, monitoring, and documentation are crucial for ensuring quality
