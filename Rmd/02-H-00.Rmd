        *   **Others:** Gram-positive bacilli (*Corynebacterium* spp., *Lactobacillus* spp.)
    *   **Prostate (Male)**
        *   **Generally Sterile:** Some organisms that are found in the urethra may be present
*   **Importance**
    *   Provides a baseline for identifying deviations from normal flora
    *   Helps interpret the clinical significance of isolated organisms

    *   **Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)**
        *   **Amsel's Criteria:** Clinical diagnostic criteria (discharge, pH, amine odor, clue cells)
        *   **Wet Mount:** Clue cells, decreased *Lactobacilli*, increased other bacteria
        *   **Gram Stain (Nugent Score):** Scoring of bacterial morphotypes
        *   **Culture:** Not routinely used
*   **Importance**
    *   Allows for the identification of the specific cause of vaginitis
    *   Guides appropriate treatment

## **Culture and/or Molecular Detection** {-}
*   **Focus:** *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, *Chlamydia trachomatis*, *Streptococcus agalactiae*, and *Mycoplasma* spp
*   **Methods and Applications**
    *   ***Neisseria gonorrhoeae***
        *   **Culture:** Selective media (TMA, NYC) followed by identification (Gram stain, oxidase, carbohydrate utilization) and AST (antibiotic susceptibility testing)
        *   **Molecular Detection:** NAATs (highly sensitive)
    *   ***Chlamydia trachomatis***
        *   **Culture:** Cell culture
        *   **Molecular Detection:** NAATs (highly sensitive)
    *   ***Streptococcus agalactiae***
