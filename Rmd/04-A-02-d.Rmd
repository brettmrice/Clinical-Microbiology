# Meningitis {-}

This section will focus on viral meningitis, specifically caused by Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and Enteroviruses, covering their etiology, epidemiology, transmission, and disease states

## **Viral Meningitis** {-}

*   **Definition:** Meningitis is inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Viral meningitis is typically less severe than bacterial meningitis
*   **Etiology:** Various viruses can cause meningitis, but the most common are enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), mumps virus, and West Nile virus

## **Enteroviruses** {-}

*   **Etiology**
    *   **Classification:** A member of the *Picornaviridae* family. Includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses
    *   **Types:** Numerous serotypes, with coxsackieviruses and echoviruses being the most common causes of viral meningitis
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Seasonality:** More common during the summer and fall months
    *   **Age Groups:** Primarily affects children and young adults
    *   **Global Distribution:** Found worldwide
*   **Transmission**
    *   **Fecal-Oral Route:** Primarily spread through the fecal-oral route, meaning through contact with fecal matter and then ingestion
    *   **Respiratory Droplets:** Can also be spread through respiratory droplets
*   **Disease States**
    *   **Viral Meningitis:** Characterized by fever, headache, stiff neck, sensitivity to light (photophobia), and nausea/vomiting
    *   **Other Infections:** Enteroviruses can also cause a variety of other illnesses, including hand, foot, and mouth disease, herpangina, conjunctivitis, and myocarditis
    *   **Severity:** Usually self-limiting and resolves within 1-2 weeks

## **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)** {-}

*   **Etiology**
    *   **Classification:** A member of the *Herpesviridae* family
    *   **Types:** HSV-1 and HSV-2 can both cause meningitis, although HSV-2 is more commonly associated with recurrent meningitis (Mollaret's meningitis)
*   **Epidemiology**
    *   **Prevalence:** HSV infections are very common, but meningitis is a less frequent complication
    *   **Age Groups:** Can affect individuals of any age
*   **Transmission**
    *   **Direct Contact:** Spread through direct contact with lesions or asymptomatic shedding
    *   **Sexual Contact:** HSV-2 is primarily transmitted through sexual contact
*   **Disease States**
    *   **Viral Meningitis:** Similar symptoms to enteroviral meningitis but can be more severe
    *   **Encephalitis:** HSV-1 is a common cause of encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), which can be life-threatening
    *   **Neonatal Herpes:** Can cause meningitis in newborns
    *   **Mollaret's Meningitis:** Recurrent episodes of meningitis associated with HSV-2
    *   **Severity:** HSV meningitis can be more severe than enteroviral meningitis, especially if encephalitis is present

## **Diagnosis of Viral Meningitis** {-}
*   **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):** Essential for diagnosing meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected and analyzed
*   **CSF Analysis**
    *   **Cell Count:** Elevated white blood cell count (pleocytosis), primarily lymphocytes
    *   **Protein:** Normal or slightly elevated protein levels
    *   **Glucose:** Normal glucose levels (helps differentiate from bacterial meningitis, where glucose is typically low)
    *   **Gram Stain and Culture:** Negative for bacteria (rules out bacterial meningitis)
*   **Viral Testing**
    *   **PCR:** Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the most sensitive and specific method for detecting viral DNA or RNA in CSF. Used to identify enteroviruses, HSV, VZV, and other viruses
    *   **Viral Culture:** Less commonly used due to lower sensitivity and longer turnaround time compared to PCR
*   **Other Tests:** Blood tests and imaging studies (e.g., MRI) may be performed to rule out other causes of meningitis or encephalitis

## **Treatment of Viral Meningitis** {-}
*   **Supportive Care:** Rest, fluids, and pain relief are the mainstays of treatment
*   **Antiviral Medications:** Acyclovir is used to treat HSV and VZV meningitis or encephalitis
*   **Hospitalization:** May be necessary for severe cases or if encephalitis is suspected

## **Prevention of Viral Meningitis** {-}
*   **Good Hygiene:** Frequent handwashing can help prevent the spread of enteroviruses
*   **Vaccination:** Vaccines are available for mumps, measles, rubella, and varicella, which can prevent meningitis caused by these viruses
*   **Safe Sex Practices:** Using condoms can reduce the risk of HSV-2 transmission
*   **Vector Control:** Mosquito control measures can help prevent West Nile virus infection

## **Key Terms** {-}

*   **Etiology:** The cause or origin of a disease or condition
*   **Epidemiology:** The study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the control of health problems
*   **Transmission:** The way a disease is spread from one person or source to another
*   **Meningitis:** Inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord
*   **Encephalitis:** Inflammation of the brain
*   **Enteroviruses:** A group of viruses that includes polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, and echoviruses
*   **Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV):** A virus that can cause oral herpes, genital herpes, and meningitis
*   **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap):** A procedure to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis
*   **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF):** The fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord
*   **Pleocytosis:** Elevated white blood cell count in the CSF
*   **PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction):** A molecular test used to detect viral DNA or RNA
*   **Acyclovir:** An antiviral medication used to treat HSV and VZV infections
*   **Mollaret's Meningitis:** Recurrent episodes of meningitis associated with HSV-2
*   **Fecal-Oral Route:** Transmission of pathogens through contact with fecal matter and then ingestion
*   **Photophobia:** Sensitivity to light
