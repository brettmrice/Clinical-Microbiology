##  **Key Terms** {-}

*   **BSL-3 (Biosafety Level 3):** A containment level for laboratories working with infectious agents that can cause serious or potentially lethal disease through inhalation. BSL-3 labs require specific engineering controls, such as a dedicated ventilation system, sealed windows and doors, and the use of a biosafety cabinet for all manipulations
*   **Select Agent:** A biological agent or toxin that has the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, animal or plant health, or to the safety of animal or plant products. These agents are regulated by the federal government, with strict requirements for handling, storage, and reporting
*   **Aerosolization:** The process by which a liquid or solid is converted into a fine mist or suspension in the air. Many BSL-3 pathogens can be transmitted via aerosols, making this a critical hazard in the laboratory
*   **Chain of Custody:** A documented process that tracks the movement of a specimen from collection to disposal, ensuring its integrity and providing a clear record of who handled it and when. Essential for legal and epidemiological purposes, especially in bioterrorism investigations
*   **Biosafety Cabinet (BSC):** A ventilated enclosure designed to provide a physical barrier to protect the user and the environment from exposure to infectious agents. BSCs are classified by performance characteristics and are a critical component of BSL-3 laboratories
*   **Inhalational Anthrax:** A severe form of anthrax caused by the inhalation of *Bacillus anthracis* spores. It is often fatal if not treated promptly
*   **Pneumonic Plague:** A severe form of plague caused by *Yersinia pestis* that affects the lungs. It is highly contagious and can be spread through respiratory droplets
*   **Ulceroglandular Tularemia:** A common form of tularemia caused by *Francisella tularensis*, characterized by an ulcer at the site of entry and swelling of the regional lymph nodes
*   **Spore:** A dormant, highly resistant form of bacteria, such as *Bacillus anthracis*, that can survive harsh environmental conditions and can be easily aerosolized, making it a significant concern in laboratory settings
*   **Laboratory Response Network (LRN):** A national network of laboratories (including clinical, state, and federal laboratories) equipped and trained to respond to biological and chemical threats. The LRN plays a crucial role in the rapid detection and identification of Select Agents
