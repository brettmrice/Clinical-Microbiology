# Organism Pathogenicity {-}

Understanding the pathogenicity of the organisms that cause CSF infections is crucial for clinical microbiology. It is essential for clinicians to diagnose, treat, and prevent these serious infections. Pathogenicity is the ability of a microorganism to cause disease, and depends on the microbe's capacity to:

1.  **Colonize:** a host
2.  **Invade:** tissues
3.  **Evade:** the host's immune defenses
4.  **Produce:** toxins or other harmful substances
