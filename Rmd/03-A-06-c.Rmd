# Rapid Growers {-}

This section focuses on the antimicrobial therapy for infections caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM). These mycobacteria species, which include the *Mycobacterium abscessus* group, *Mycobacterium chelonae*, and *Mycobacterium fortuitum*, pose unique treatment challenges due to their intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Drug Susceptibility Testing (DST):** DST is essential for guiding treatment decisions for RGM infections, as susceptibility patterns can vary significantly among species and even within species
*   **Species-Level Identification:** Accurate species-level identification is crucial, as different RGM species have different susceptibility profiles
*   **Combination Therapy:** Treatment of RGM infections typically involves a combination of multiple drugs to improve efficacy and prevent the emergence of drug resistance
*   **Prolonged Treatment Duration:** Treatment durations for RGM infections are often longer than those for *M. tuberculosis* infections
*   **Surgical Intervention:** Surgical excision or debridement of infected tissue may be necessary in some cases, particularly for skin and soft tissue infections
*   **Biofilm Formation:** RGM, particularly *M. abscessus*, can form biofilms, which can make them more resistant to antibiotics
*   **Monitoring for Adverse Effects:** Anti-RGM drugs can cause a variety of adverse effects, and patients should be closely monitored during treatment
*    **Route of Administration:** Intravenous administration of antimicrobials is usually preferred

## ***Mycobacterium abscessus* Group** {-}

*   **Treatment Challenges:** *M. abscessus* is highly resistant to many antibiotics, making treatment particularly challenging. The *M. abscessus* group consists of three subspecies: *M. abscessus subsp. abscessus*, *M. abscessus subsp. massiliense*, and *M. abscessus subsp. bolletii*. *M. abscessus subsp. massiliense* is usually more susceptible to macrolides, therefore, speciation is critical
*   **Recommended Treatment Approach**
    *   **Inducible Macrolide Resistance:** *M. abscessus* often exhibits inducible macrolide resistance, meaning that resistance develops during prolonged exposure to macrolides. To overcome this, a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin) should be administered with other drugs
    *   **Initial Intensive Phase**
        *   Amikacin or tobramycin
        *   Cefoxitin or imipenem
        *   Clarithromycin or azithromycin (if susceptible)
    *   **Continuation Phase**
        *   Clarithromycin or azithromycin (if susceptible)
        *   Linezolid
        *   Moxifloxacin or tigecycline (based on susceptibility)
    *   **Treatment Duration:** Treatment should continue for at least 12 months after clinical improvement
    *   **Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Patients:** *M. abscessus* pulmonary infections are common in CF patients. Treatment is similar to that for non-CF patients, but may require prolonged intravenous therapy and inhaled amikacin
*   **Drug Susceptibility Testing:** DST is essential for guiding treatment decisions. Susceptibility testing should include macrolides, aminoglycosides, carbapenems, linezolid, tigecycline, and other potential agents
*   **Surgical Management:** Surgical excision of infected tissue or drainage of abscesses may be necessary
*   **Inhaled Amikacin:** Inhaled amikacin may be used as adjunctive therapy for pulmonary infections
*   **Monitoring:** Patients should be monitored for adverse effects of all drugs, including ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity with aminoglycosides

## ***Mycobacterium chelonae*** {-}

*   **Treatment Regimen**
    *   *M. chelonae* is generally more susceptible to antibiotics than *M. abscessus*
    *   **Recommended Drugs**
        *   Clarithromycin or azithromycin
        *   Amikacin or tobramycin
        *   Linezolid
        *   Ciprofloxacin or moxifloxacin
    *   **Treatment Duration:** Treatment duration varies depending on the site and severity of the infection, but typically ranges from 4-6 months
*   **Drug Susceptibility Testing:** DST should be performed to guide treatment decisions
*   **Surgical Management:** Surgical excision of infected tissue or removal of foreign bodies may be necessary for localized infections

## ***Mycobacterium fortuitum*** {-}

*   **Treatment Regimen**
    *   *M. fortuitum* is generally susceptible to several antibiotics
    *   **Recommended Drugs**
        *   Amikacin or tobramycin
        *   Cefoxitin or imipenem
        *   Doxycycline or minocycline
        *   Ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin
        *   Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX)
    *   **Treatment Duration:** Treatment duration varies depending on the site and severity of the infection, but typically ranges from 3-6 months
*   **Drug Susceptibility Testing:** DST should be performed to guide treatment decisions
*   **Surgical Management:** Surgical excision of infected tissue or drainage of abscesses may be necessary for localized infections
