# Major Pathogens {-}

Identifying Mycobacteria and Nocardia involves a combination of techniques, starting with recognizing their unique characteristics. This section covers the key features used in initial identification of major pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAC), Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium abscessus group, Mycobacterium marinum, and Nocardia species

## **General Principles** {-}

*   **Acid-Fast Staining:** This is the cornerstone of mycobacterial and *Nocardia* identification. Remember, the cell walls of these organisms contain mycolic acids, which make them resistant to decolorization with acid-alcohol after staining
*   **Colony Morphology:** The appearance of colonies on solid media (e.g., size, shape, color, texture) can provide clues to the identity of the organism
*   **Growth Rate:** Mycobacteria are generally slow-growing, but some species grow faster than others. *Nocardia* also grows slower than typical bacteria
*   **Environmental Factors:** Temperature, light, and the presence of specific nutrients can influence growth characteristics

## **Acid-Fast Reaction** {-}

*   **Principle:** The acid-fast stain uses a primary dye (carbolfuchsin), a decolorizer (acid-alcohol), and a counterstain (methylene blue or malachite green)
*   **Procedure**
    1.  **Smear Preparation:** Prepare a thin smear of the specimen or culture on a glass slide
    2.  **Fixation:** Heat-fix the smear to kill the bacteria and adhere them to the slide
    3.  **Staining:** Flood the smear with carbolfuchsin and apply heat (Ziehl-Neelsen) or allow to stain for a longer period (Kinyoun)
    4.  **Decolorization:** Decolorize with acid-alcohol until the smear is clear
    5.  **Counterstaining:** Counterstain with methylene blue or malachite green
*   **Interpretation**
    *   **Acid-Fast Bacteria (AFB):** Appear red or pink against a blue or green background
    *   **Non-Acid-Fast Bacteria:** Appear blue or green
*   **Reporting:** Report the number of AFB observed per field (e.g., no AFB seen, 1-9 AFB/field, 1+, 2+, 3+)
