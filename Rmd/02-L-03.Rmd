# Molecular Methods {-}

This section focuses on the molecular methods used for MRSA/MSSA, VRE, ESBL/CRE screening. Molecular techniques offer high sensitivity, specificity, and can provide rapid results

## **MRSA/MSSA Screening** {-}

*   **Target:** *mecA* gene (confers methicillin resistance)
*   **Methods**
    *   **Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)**
        *   **Real-Time PCR (qPCR):** This is the most common and preferred method. qPCR is a rapid and sensitive technique that amplifies and detects the *mecA* gene directly from the specimen. Results are usually available within a few hours
        *   **Conventional PCR:** Amplifies the *mecA* gene, followed by detection using gel electrophoresis. This method is less rapid than qPCR
    *   **Isothermal Amplification**
        *   **Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP):** This is a rapid and simple method that amplifies the *mecA* gene at a constant temperature. It can be performed with minimal equipment and provides results in a short time
    *   **Molecular Hybridization**
        *   **Nucleic acid hybridization assays:** Probes specific for the *mecA* gene can be used to detect the presence of the gene in a sample

##  **VRE Screening** {-}

*   **Target:** *vanA*, *vanB*, or other *van* genes (confer vancomycin resistance)
*   **Methods**
    *   **PCR**
        *   **Real-Time PCR (qPCR):** Detects the *vanA* or *vanB* genes directly from the specimen
        *   **Conventional PCR:** Amplifies the *vanA* or *vanB* genes, followed by gel electrophoresis
    *   **Isothermal Amplification**
        *   **LAMP:** Can be used to detect the *vanA* or *vanB* genes
    *   **Molecular Hybridization**
        *   **Nucleic acid hybridization assays:** Probes specific for the *vanA* or *vanB* genes can be used to detect the presence of the gene in a sample

##  **ESBL/CRE Screening** {-}

*   **Targets:** Genes encoding ESBLs (e.g., *blaCTX-M*, *blaTEM*, *blaSHV*), carbapenemases (e.g., *blaKPC*, *blaOXA-48*, *blaNDM*, *blaIMP*, *blaVIM*)
*   **Methods**
    *   **PCR**
        *   **Real-Time PCR (qPCR):** Detects the genes encoding ESBLs and carbapenemases. Multiplex PCR assays can be used to simultaneously detect multiple resistance genes
        *   **Conventional PCR:** Amplifies the genes encoding ESBLs or carbapenemases, followed by gel electrophoresis
    *   **Multiplex PCR:** A single PCR reaction can amplify multiple target sequences simultaneously, enabling the detection of several resistance genes in one test
    *   **Microarrays:** Nucleic acid microarrays can be used to screen for a wide range of resistance genes in a single test
    *   **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS):** NGS can be used to identify all resistance genes present in a sample, providing a comprehensive picture of the resistance profile

##  **Key Considerations for Molecular Methods** {-}

*   **Advantages**
    *   **Rapid Results:** Molecular methods often provide results within hours, which is significantly faster than culture-based methods
    *   **High Sensitivity:** Can detect low levels of organisms or resistance genes
    *   **High Specificity:** Minimize false-positive results by targeting specific genes
    *   **Direct Detection:** Can be performed directly on clinical specimens without the need for culture
*   **Disadvantages**
    *   **Cost:** Molecular methods can be more expensive than culture-based methods, though costs are decreasing
    *   **Equipment and Expertise:** Require specialized equipment and trained personnel
    *   **Targeted Approach:** Only detect the specific resistance genes targeted by the assay. They may not detect novel resistance mechanisms
    *   **Potential for False Positives:** Can occur if there is contamination or if the assay is not properly validated
*   **Quality Control**
    *   **Positive and Negative Controls:** Include positive and negative controls in each run to ensure the assay is working correctly
    *   **Internal Controls:** Use internal controls to monitor for the presence of inhibitors in the sample
    *   **Validation:** Validate the assay before use to determine its sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility
*   **Interpretation**
    *   Molecular tests detect the presence of resistance genes, not necessarily whether the organism is expressing the resistance
    *   Phenotypic susceptibility testing is still needed to confirm resistance and guide antibiotic therapy
